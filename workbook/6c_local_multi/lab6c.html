      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In this chapter, we cover the extension of the concept of local spatial autocorrelation to
        the multivariate domain. This turns out to be particularly challenging due to the difficulty
        in separating pure attribute correlation among multiple variables from the spatial effects.</p>
      <p>We consider three methods. First, we discuss a bivariate version of the Local Moran, which
        is useful in a space-time context, but needs to be interpreted with great caution in pure
        cross-sectional settings. We next outline an extension of the Local Geary statistic to the
        multivariate Local Geary. We close with a discussion of a recently introduced
        <em>local neighbor match test</em>.
      </p>
      <p>As in the previous Chapter, we continue to use both the <strong>natregimes</strong> and the
        <strong>Guerry</strong> data
        sets to illustrate these methods.</p>

        <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
        <p>As in the previous Chapter, we will continue to use both
          the <strong>Guerry</strong> data set and the <strong>natregimes</strong> data set. For each of
          these, we need an active spatial weights matrix, e.g., <strong>guerry_85_q</strong> for the former and
          <strong>natregimes_q</strong> for
          the latter. See the description in earlier Chapters on how to accomplish this.</p>
        <p>Also, as in the previous Chapter, we need some further preparation of the <strong>natregimes</strong> data
          set to make the variables time sensitive. If not done so already, we need to use
          the <strong>Time Editor</strong> to group the homicide rates <strong>hr60</strong> through
          <strong>hr90</strong>
          into the variable <strong>hr</strong> (we do not need the count variables in this Chapter).</p>

    <div id="the-multivariate-spatial-autocorrelation-problem" class="section level2 unnumbered" number="">
      <h2>The Multivariate Spatial Autocorrelation Problem</h2>
      <p>Designing a spatial autocorrelation statistic in a multivariate setting is fraught with difficulty.
        The most common statistic, Moran’s I, is based on a cross-product association, which is the same
        as a bivariate correlation statistic. As a result, it is difficult to disentangle whether the correlation
        between multiple variables at adjoining locations is due to the correlation among the variables, or
        a similarity due to being neighbors in space.</p>
      <p>Early attempts at extending Moran’s I to multiple variables focused on principal components, as in
        the suggestion by <span class="citation">Wartenberg (<a href="#ref-Wartenberg:85"
            role="doc-biblioref">1985</a>)</span>, and later work by <span class="citation">Dray, Saïd, and Débias (<a
            href="#ref-Drayetal:08" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. However, these proposals only
        dealt with a global statistic. A more local perspective along the same lines is presented in <span
          class="citation">Lin (<a href="#ref-Lin:20" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>,
        although it is primarily a special case of a geographically weighted regression, or GWR <span
          class="citation">(Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton <a href="#ref-Fotheringhametal:02"
            role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="citation">Lee (<a href="#ref-LeeS:01" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> outlined a way to
        separate a bivariate Moran-like spatial correlation coefficient into
        a spatial part and a Pearson correlation coefficient. However, this relies on some fairly strong
        simplifying assumptions that may not be realistic in practice.</p>
      <p>In <span class="citation">Anselin (<a href="#ref-Anselin:18" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, the idea is
        proposed to focus on the distance between observations in both attribute and
        geographical space and to construct statistics that assess the match between those distances. In general,
        the squared multi-attribute distance between a pair of observations <span class="math inline">\(i, j\)</span> on
        <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> variables is given as:
        <span class="math display">\[d_{ij}^2 = || x_i - x_j || = \sum_{h=1}^k (x_{ih} - x_{jh})^2,\]</span>
        with <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_j\)</span> as vectors of
        observations. In some expressions, the squared distance will be preferred,
        in others, the actual distance (<span class="math inline">\(d_{ij}\)</span>, its square root) will be used. The
        overall idea is to identify observations
        that are both <em>close</em> in multiattribute space and close in geographical space.
      </p>
      <p>First, we consider a simple bivariate extension of the Local Moran, which is not based on the distance
        measures.</p>

      <h2>Bivariate Local Moran</h2>
      <div id="principle" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Principle</h3>
        <p>The treatment of the bivariate Local Moran’s I closely follows that of its
          global counterpart <span class="citation">(see also Anselin, Syabri, and Smirnov <a
              href="#ref-Anselinetal:02b" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>. In essence, it captures the
          relationship between the value
          for one variable at location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>,
          and the average of the neighboring values for
          <em>another variable</em>, i.e., its spatial lag <span class="math inline">\(\sum_j w_{ij} y_j\)</span>. Apart
          from a constant scaling factor (that
          can be ignored), the statistic is the product of <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> with the
          spatial lag of <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\sum_j
            w_{ij}y_j\)</span>), with both variables standardized, such that their
          means are zero and variances equal one:
        </p>
        <p><span class="math display">\[ I_{i}^B = c x_i \sum_j w_{ij} y_j,\]</span>
          where <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij}\)</span> are the elements of the spatial weights matrix.</p>
        <p>As is the case for its global counterpart, this statistic needs to be interpreted with caution, since it
          ignores in-situ correlation between the two variables (see the discussion of global bivariate spatial
          autocorrelation for details).</p>
        <p>A special case of the bivariate Local Moran statistic is comparing the same variable at two points in time.
          The most meaningful application is where one variable is for time period <span
            class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, say <span class="math inline">\(z_t\)</span>, and the other variable is
          for the neighbors in the previous time period, say <span class="math inline">\(z_{t-1}\)</span>. This
          formulation measures the extent to which the value at a location in a given time period is correlated with the
          values at neighboring locations in a previous time period, or an inward influence. It is illustrated in the
          example below.</p>
        <p>An alternative view is to consider <span class="math inline">\(z_{t-1}\)</span> and the neighbors at the
          current time. This would measure the correlation
          between a location and its neighbors at a later time, or an outward influence. The first specification is more
          accepted, as
          it fits within a standard space-time regression framework.</p>

          in Figure <a href="#fig:bivariatelisa">1</a>,

        <p>Next, we proceed in the usual fashion by selecting a variable for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, for
          example
          <strong>hr(90)</strong>, and a variable for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, say
          <strong>hr(80)</strong>, in the variable selection
          dialog, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:bivlisavars">2</a>. Since the variables are time enabled, the proper
          period is selected by means of the <strong>Time</strong> drop down list. Also note that the spatial weights
          matrix has been set to <strong>natregimes_q</strong>.

      <div id="interpretation" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Interpretation</h3>
        <p>As mentioned, the interpretation of the bivariate Local Moran cluster map warrants some caution, since it
          does not control for the correlation between the two variables at each location (i.e., the correlation between
          <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span>). To illustrate this
          issue, consider the space-time case, where one can interpret the results of the High-High and Low-Low clusters
          in Figure <a href="#fig:bivlisacluster">3</a> as locations where high/low values at time <span
            class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (in our example, homicide rates in 1990) were surrounded by high/low values
          at time <span class="math inline">\(t -1\)</span> (homicide rates in 1980) more so than would be the case
          randomly. This could either be attributed to the surrounding locations in the past affecting the central
          location at the current time (a form of a diffusion effect), but could also be due to a strong inertia, in
          which case there would be no diffusion. More precisely, if the homicide rates in all locations are highly
          correlated over time, then if the surrounding values in <span class="math inline">\(t - 1\)</span> were
          correlated with the value at <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(t -
            1\)</span>, then they would also tend to be correlated with the value at <span
            class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (through the correlation between
          <span class="math inline">\(y_{j,t-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_{j,t}\)</span>). Hence, while
          these findings <em>could</em> be compatible with diffusion, this is not necessarily the case. The same
          complication affects the interpretation of the bivariate Local Moran coefficient between two variables at the
          same point in time.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the problems with interpreting bivariate local cluster maps, we take the case of spatial
          outliers. In addition to the bivariate results, we also consider the univariate Local
          Moran cluster maps for the variable in each time period, i.e., in <span class="math inline">\(t - 1\)</span>
          and in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, i.e., <strong>hr(80)</strong> and <strong>hr(90)</strong>, as
          shown in Figures <a href="#fig:bivspacetime">4</a> and <a href="#fig:localhr90">5</a>.</p>

          was not significant. In this instance, we can interpret the spatial outlier in the space-time cluster map as
          indicating a
          (relative) decrease in the homicide rate for that county in 1990 relative to 1980, when it was surrounded by
          high homicide rate counties. However, what we cannot conclude is that the surrounding counties still have high
          homicide rates in 1990. In fact, the pattern is
          insufficient to be considered significant.</p>

      <h2>Multivariate Local Geary</h2>
      <div id="principle-1" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Principle</h3>
        <p>In <span class="citation">Anselin (<a href="#ref-Anselin:18" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, a
          multivariate extension of the Local Geary statistic is proposed. This statistic measures the extent to which
          neighbors in multiattribute space (i.e., data points that are close together in the multidimensional variable
          space) are also neighbors in geographical space. While the mathematical formalism is easily extended to many
          variables, in practice one quickly runs into the <em>curse of dimensionality</em>.</p>
        <p>In essence, the Multivariate Local Geary statistic measures the extent to which the average distance in
          attribute space between the values at a location and the values at its neighboring locations are smaller or
          larger than what they would be under spatial randomness. The former case corresponds to positive spatial
          autocorrelation, the latter to negative spatial autocorrelation.</p>
        <p>An important aspect of the multivariate statistic is that it is not simply the superposition of univariate
          statistics. In other words, even though a location may be identified as a cluster using the univariate Local
          Geary for each of the variables separately, this does not mean that it is also a multivariate cluster. The
          univariate statistics deal with distances in attribute space projected onto a single dimension, whereas the
          multivariate statistics are based on distances in a higher dimensional space. The multivariate statistic thus
          provides an additional perspective to measuring the tension between attribute similarity and locational
          similarity.</p>
        <p>The Multivariate Local Geary statistic is formally the sum of individual Local Geary statistics for each of
          the variables under consideration. For example, with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> variables, indexed
          by <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, the corresponding expression is:
          <span class="math display">\[c_i^M = \sum_{h=1}^k \sum_j w_{ij} (x_{hi} - x_{hj})^2.\]</span>
          This measure corresponds to a weighted average of the squared distances in multidimensional attribute space
          between the values observed at a given geographic location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and those at
          its geographic neighbors <span class="math inline">\(j \in N_i\)</span> (with <span
            class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span> as
          the neighborhood set of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>).
        </p>
        <p>To achieve comparable values for the statistics, one can correct for the number of variables involved, as
          <span class="math inline">\(c_i^M / k\)</span>. This is the approach taken in <code>GeoDa</code>.</p>
        <p>Inference can again be based on a conditional permutation approach. This consists of holding the
          <em>tuple</em> of values observed at <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> fixed, and computing the statistic
          for a number of permutations of the remaining tuples over the other locations. Note that because the full
          tuple is being used in the permutation, the internal correlation of the variables is controlled for, and only
          the <em>spatial</em> component gets altered.</p>
        <p>The permutation results in an empirical reference distribution that represents a computational approach at
          obtaining the distribution of the statistic under the null. The associated pseudo p-value corresponds to the
          fraction of statistics in the empirical reference distribution that are equal to or more extreme than the
          observed statistic.</p>
        <p>Such an approach suffers from the same problem of multiple comparisons mentioned for all the other local
          statistics. In addition, there is a further complication. When comparing the results for <span
            class="math inline">\(k\)</span> univariate Local Geary statistics, these multiple comparisons need to be
          accounted for as well.</p>
        <p>For example, for each univariate test, the target p-value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>
          would typically be adjusted to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha / k\)</span> (with <span
            class="math inline">\(k\)</span> variables, each with a univariate test), as a Bonferroni bound. Since the
          multivariate statistic is in essence a sum of the statistics for the univariate cases, this would suggest a
          similar approach by dividing the target p-value by the number of variables (<span
            class="math inline">\(k\)</span>). Alternatively, and preferable, a FDR strategy can be pursued. The extent
          to which this actually compensates for the two dimensions of multiple comparison (multiple variables and
          multiple observations) remains to be further investigated.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"

          <h4>Univariate analysis of multiple variables</h4>
          <p>Before moving on to the multivariate case, we consider what we learn from a univariate analysis
            of multiple variables. We will use the <strong>Geary</strong> data set and the variables crimes against
            persons
            (<strong>Crm_prs</strong>), crimes against property (<strong>Crm_prp</strong>), and donations
            (<strong>Donatns</strong>).</p>
          <p>We first gain a general perspective on the spatial distribution of each variable by means of a set of
            quintile maps, shown in Figures <a href="#fig:quintpers">6</a> to <a href="#fig:quintdon">8</a>.</p>

          <p>These maps illustrate the challenge encountered when trying to quantify multivariate spatial correlation,
            in that they bring out very different patterns.
            For example, as we may recall from previous Chapters, we notice the concentration of lowest quintile values
            in the
            south-east of the country for <strong>Donatns</strong> (in Figure <a href="#fig:quintdon">8</a>), that is
            somewhat matched by
            a similar pattern for <strong>Crm_prs</strong> (in Figure <a href="#fig:quintpers">6</a>). However, for
            <strong>Crm_prp</strong>, the opposite seems
            to be the case (Figure <a href="#fig:quintprop">7</a>). The lack of correspondence is also indicated by a
            fairly weak
            pairwise correlation between these variables: 0.255 between <strong>Crm_prs</strong> and
            <strong>Crm_prp</strong>, 0.134 between
            <strong>Crm_prs</strong> and <strong>Donatns</strong>, and -0.082 between <strong>Crm_prp</strong> and
            <strong>Donatns</strong> <span class="citation">(see Anselin <a href="#ref-Anselin:18"
                role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>, 141)</span>.
          </p>
          <p>We further summarize the patterns by means of a Local Geary cluster map for each individual variable,
            shown in Figures <a href="#fig:lgpers">9</a> to <a href="#fig:lgdon">11</a>. This confirms the lack of match
            between the
            individual spatial distributions (for queen contiguity, with 999 permutations and p=0.05). We find
            confirmation of the strong Low-Low cluster in the south-east for <strong>Crm_prs</strong> and
            <strong>Donatns</strong>, but for
            <strong>Crm_prp</strong>, there seems to be a small Low-Low cluster in the north. Also note several
            instances of
            spatial outliers, as well as one example where positive spatial autocorrelation could not be classified
            for <strong>Crm_prp</strong> (i.e., <em>Other Positive</em>, in Figure <a href="#fig:lgprop">10</a>).

            Only one observation is significant for all three variables, but it is a spatial outlier for

            conflicting patterns.
            The map also shows that 39 observations are not significant for all three variables (0 in the legend),

          <p>All the usual options regarding the number of permutations, the significance filter, and saving the results
            hold as for any other local spatial statistic in <code>GeoDa</code>. While we do not pursue this further

            recommended.</p>

        <h3>Interpretation</h3>
        <p>The results of the Multivariate Local Geary significance or cluster map are not always easy to interpret.
          Mainly, this is because we tend to simply superimpose the results of the univariate tests, whereas the
          multivariate statistic involves different tradeoffs.</p>
        <p>As mentioned, the problem of multiple comparisons means that the use of the default p-value of 0.05 is almost
          certainly misleading. A useful alternative is to use the False Discovery Rate, although this only works in
          small to medium
          sized data set, due to the maximum on the number permutations in the current implementation of
          <code>GeoDa</code>. In our
          example, a p-value of 0.01 also corresponds roughly to the FDR. We illustrate the effect of tightening the
          p-value in
          Figure <a href="#fig:multigearyfdr">15</a> (we increased the number of permuations to 99,999, but no
          observations were
          significant at p &lt; 0.001). The number of <em>significant</em> locations in cut in half and reduced to 18.
          The strongest
          cluster is found in the south-east.</p>

          <p>In order to illustrate the complexity of the multivariate case, Figure <a href="#fig:3ddistance">16</a>
            shows three neighboring
            highly significant locations in the cluster selected in both the significance map and a 3D data cube. The
            links to the neighbors are also highlighted.
            This shows that even though the observations in question are very close in multi-attribute space, some of
            their
            neighbors are much further removed. This highlights the tradeoffs involved in the averaging of the
            individual
            squared distances from the Local Geary statistics. This is not always intuitive. With three variables, this
            can
            be visualized in a 3D data cube, but with more variables, this is much harder.</p>

        <h3>Principle</h3>
        <p>An alternative approach to visualize and quantify the tradeoff between geographical and attribute
          similarity was suggested by <span class="citation">Anselin and Li (<a href="#ref-AnselinLi:20"
              role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> in the form of what is called a <em>local neighbor match test</em>.
          The basic idea is to assess the extent of overlap between k-nearest neighbors in geographical space
          and k-nearest neighbors in multi-attribute space.</p>
        <p>In <code>GeoDa</code>, this is a simple intersection operation between two k-nearest neighbor weights
          matrices,
          one computed for the variables (standardized) and one using geographical distance. We can then
          quantify the probability that an overlap occurs between the two neighbor sets. This corresponds to the
          probability
          of drawing <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> common neighbors from the <span
            class="math inline">\(k\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(n - 1 - k\)</span> possible choices as
          neighbors,
          a straightforward combinatorial calculation.</p>
        <p>More formally, the probability of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> shared neighbors out of <span
            class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is:
          <span class="math display">\[p = C(k,v).C(N-k,k-v) / C(N,k),\]</span>
          where <span class="math inline">\(N = n - 1\)</span> (one less than the number of observations), <span
            class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of nearest neighbors considered
          in the connectivity graphs, <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the number of neighbors in common, and
          <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the combinatorial operator.
          Alternatively, a pseudo p-value can be computed based on a permutation approach, although that is not
          pursued in <code>GeoDa</code>.
        </p>
        <p>The degree of overlap can be visualized by means of a cardinality map (a special case of a unique values
          map),
          where each location indicates how many neighbors the two weights matrices have in common. In addition,
          different
          p-value cut-offs can be employed to select the <em>significant</em> locations, i.e., where the probability of
          a given
          number of common neighbors falls below the chosen p.</p>
        <p>In practice, the value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> may need to be adjusted (increased) in order
          to find meaningful results. In addition,
          the k-nearest neighbor calculation becomes increasingly difficult to implement in very high attribute
          dimensions,
          due to the empty space problem.</p>
        <p>The idea of matching neighbors can be extended to distances among variables obtained from dimension reduction
          techniques, such as
          multidimensional scaling, covered in a later Chapter <span class="citation">(see also the more detailed
            discussion in Anselin and Li <a href="#ref-AnselinLi:20" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the approach taken for the Multivariate Local Geary, the local neighbor match test focuses
          on the distances directly, rather than converting them into a weighted average. Both measures have in common
          that they focus on squared distances in attribute space, rather than a cross-product as in the Moran
          statistics.</p>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>We illustrate the local neighbor match test by means of the <strong>Guerry</strong> data set. We use the same
          six
          variables as before: <strong>Crm_prs</strong>, <strong>Crm_prp</strong>, <strong>Litercy</strong>,
          <strong>Donatns</strong>, <strong>Infants</strong> and <strong>Suicids</strong>. We first illustrate the logic
          behind the method and then show
          its implementation in <code>GeoDa</code>.
        </p>
        <p>We start by creating two k-nearest neighbor weights matrices for k=6, one based on Euclidean geographical
          distance, the other on multi-variable distance using the six specified variables in z-standardized form.
          Both matrices should be contained in the <strong>Weights Manager</strong>.</p>
        <div id="intersection-between-connectivity-graphs" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Intersection between connectivity graphs</h4>
          <p>We compare the connectivity graphs for the geographical (<strong>guerry_85_kd6</strong>) and the
            multi-variable
            (<strong>guerry_85_k6v</strong>) weights. They are shown side-by-side in Figure <a
              href="#fig:connintersection">19</a>, with the geographical
            connectivity on the left. Whereas the latter has the familiar form, the multi-variable connectivity is quite
            complex and shows connections between locations that are far apart in geographical space.</p>

            before.
            In addition, we set the <strong>Number of Neighbors</strong> to 6, and use <strong>Euclidean
              Distance</strong> for both neighbor criteria.
            Finally, we also make sure that the variables are used in <strong>standardized</strong> form.</p>

            the line between significant and not. We can now use the <strong>Selection Tool</strong>
            in the table to select all observations with a p-value of less than 0.05 (or any other relevant value). This
            results in the significant locations being highlighted in the cardinality map, as in Figure <a
              href="#fig:matchsconnsig">25</a>.
            It turns out that for this cut-off, there are 21 significant observations, all with 3 or more neighbors in

          <h4>Local neighbor match and Multivariate Local Geary</h4>
          <p>To close, we compare the most significant locations identified by the Multivariate Local Geary and the
            local neighbor
            match test. We used 99,999 permutations and a p-value of 0.01 for the Local Geary cluster map.</p>
          <p>In Figure <a href="#fig:matchsmultig1">27</a> we select the most significant location in the local neighbor
            match test map on
            the left. Its 5 neighbors
            that are common on the two criteria are highlighted as well. In the cluster map on the left, we
            find the corresponding location and its neighbors. As it turns out, the central location (department of
            Tarn) is identified
            as having a p-value of 0.0001 in the cluster map. One of its neighbors achieves the same value, while two
            have p=0.001,
            and on p = 0.01. However, one of the common neighbors is not significant according to the Multivariate Local
            Geary.
            Nevertheless, the match between the two approaches is striking, confirming that both use a similar
            perspective.</p>

          <p>In Figure <a href="#fig:matchsmultig2">28</a>, we take the opposite approach. We select the 11 locations in
            the right-hand map that
            are significant at p=0.0001. The left-hand panel shows the matching selection in the local neighbor match
            test. In addition to the Tarn department with 5 matches, we also find three of the four departments with 4
            matches to be identified in both maps. In all, of the 11 significant Local Geary locations, 9 are
            significant at p=0.05 in the local neigbhor match map. Interestingly, two significant Local Geary locations
            (Basses-Alpes and Ariege) only have two common neighbors.</p>

          <p>We investigate the connectivity pattern for those two locations more closely in Figure <a
              href="#fig:matchsmultig3">29</a>.
            In the right-hand panel, we see how the multi-attribute neighbors for both departments tend to be far
            removed
            geographically. In the averaging operation that is behind the Multivariate Local Geary, the difference with
            the
            contiguous locations are averaged out. In the local neighbor match test, the focus is singularly on the
            distances
            themselves.</p>

          <p>In spite of these slight discrepancies between the two methods, they tend to identify the same broad
            clusters.
            Given that it has fewer issues with determining the proper p-value, the local neighbor match test thus
            provides
            a viable alternative to detect multivariate spatial clusters.</p>
