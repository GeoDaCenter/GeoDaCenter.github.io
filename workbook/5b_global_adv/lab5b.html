<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this lab, we consider some extensions to the visualization of spatial autocorrelation by means of the Moran scatter plot. Specifically, we extend the association between a variable and its spatial lag to the context where the variable and the lag pertain to two different variables, in the form of a bivariate Moran scatter plot. We focus on this especially in the context of relating a variable to its neighbors in a different time period. We also consider a refinement of this concept that applies the notion of a Moran scatter plot to the first difference (or any difference) of time-enabled variables, as the differential Moran scatter plot. We close with an adjustment of Moran’s I designed to deal with the variance instability of rates or proportions, the EBI Moran scatter plot.</p>
<p>We will again use the <strong>U.S. Homicides</strong> sample data set that comes pre-installed with GeoDa. It contains values for homicides and several socio-economic determinants for the 3085 counties in the continental United States.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Before exploring the bivariate extensions, we turn a few of the variables in the <strong>natregimes</strong> data set into time-enabled variables. Specifically, using the techniques illustrated earlier, we <em>group</em> the homicide rates <strong>hr60</strong> through <strong>hr90</strong> into <strong>hr</strong>, the homicide counts <strong>hc60</strong> to <strong>hc90</strong> into <strong>hc</strong>, and the population counts <strong>po60</strong> through <strong>po90</strong> into <strong>po</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to the grouped variables, we also need to create at least one spatial weights matrix, e.g., <strong>natregimes_q</strong> for first order queen contiguity.</p>
<p>After saving all this information into a project file, we clear the current project and load the new project file into the <strong>Connect to Data Sources</strong> dialog. This brings up the familiar green themeless U.S. counties map.</p>

</div>
<div id="bivariate-spatial-correlation---a-word-of-caution" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Bivariate Spatial Correlation - A Word of Caution</h2>
<p>The concept of bivariate spatial correlation is complex and often misinterpreted. It is typically considered to be the correlation between one variable and the spatial lag of another variable, as originally implemented in the precursor of GeoDa <span class="citation">(e.g., as described in Anselin, Syabri, and Smirnov 2002)</span>. However, this does not take into account the inherent correlation between the two variables. More precisely, the bivariate spatial correlation is between <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_j w_{ij} y_j\)</span>, but does not take into account the correlation between <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>As a result, this statistic is often interpreted incorrectly, as it may overestimate the spatial aspect of the correlation that instead may be due mostly to the in-place correlation. <span class="citation">Lee (2001)</span> provides an alternative that considers a separation between the correlative aspect and the spatial aspect, but we will not pursue that here.</p>
<p>Below, we provide a more in-depth assessment of the different aspects of bivariate spatial and non-spatial association, but first we turn to the original concept of a bivariate Moran scatter plot.</p>
</div>
<div id="bivariate-moran-scatter-plot" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Bivariate Moran Scatter Plot</h2>
<p>The <strong>Bivariate Moran’s I</strong> is invoked from the menu or from the drop-down list provided by selecting the <strong>Moran Scatter Plot</strong> icon on the toolbar.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics5b/1_521_bivariate_icon.png" alt="Bivariate Moran scatter plot icon" width="25%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The next dialog brings up the variable specification. In our example, we will illustrate the most useful way to employ bivariate spatial correlation, i.e., its application to assess the correlation between a variable and its neighbors at a different time period. Ignoring the in-situ temporal correlation, such a measure gives insight into the extent to which neighboring locations in a previous time period are correlated with the value at a location at a future time period. In other words, this gives some indication of space-time correlation (but see below for more refined analysis).</p>
<p>To illustrate this functionality, we select as the x-axis variable, the homicide rate in 1990 – <strong>hr (90)</strong> –, and as the y-axis its value in 1980 – <strong>hr (80)</strong> –, which will be the spatial lag. The dialog is the familiar one for time-enabled variables, with the <strong>Time</strong> drop down list allowing variables to be selected for different time periods, and the spatial weights specified in the <strong>Weights</strong> list. In our example, the spatial weights are the queen contiguity weights, <strong>natregimes_q</strong>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics5b/1_522_biv_variables.png" alt="Bivariate Moran scatter variable selection" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Bivariate Moran scatter variable selection
</p>
</div>
<p>The bivariate Moran scatter plot has the <strong>spatial lag of hr (80)</strong> (y) as the <em>dependent</em> variable and <strong>hr (90)</strong> (x) as the explanatory variable. This yields a Moran’s I-like statistic as <span class="math inline">\((\sum_j w_{ij} y_j) x_i / \sum_i (x_i)^2\)</span>, or, the slope of a regression of <span class="math inline">\(Wy\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (all variables being standardized, such that their means are zero and their variance one, and with the spatial weights row-standardized).</p>
<p>Note that unlike in the pure autocorrelation case, the regression of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Wy\)</span> also yields an unbiased estimate of the slope, providing an alternative perspective on bivariate spatial correlation (see below for further discussion).<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The bivariate Moran scatter plot shows the regression of <span class="math inline">\(Wy\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> with a slope of about 0.360, as illustrated below.</p>

<p class="caption">
Bivariate moran scatter plot
</p>
</div>
<p>All the same options as for the univariate Moran scatter plot apply here as well. For example, a permutation inference would indicated a high significance of the association, with a pseudo p-value of 0.001 (for 999 permutations).<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Also, the standardized value of the x variable and the spatial lag of the y-variable (applied to its standardized value) can be saved to the table, in the same way as for the univariate Moran’s scatter plot.</p>
<div id="a-closer-look-at-bivariate-spatial-correlation" class="section level3">
<h3>A closer look at bivariate spatial correlation</h3>
<p>In contrast to the univariate Moran scatter plot, where the interpretation of the linear fit is unequivocably Moran’s I, there is no such clarity in the bivariate case. In addition to the interpretation offered above, which is a <em>traditional</em> Moran’s I-like coefficient, there are at least four additional perspectives that are relevant. We consider each in turn.</p>
<p>First, we need to consider the bivariate correlation between the homicide rate in the two time periods, i.e., <strong>hr (90)</strong> and <strong>hr (80)</strong>. To implement this, we create four new variables. First, we standardize the homicide rates for each of the years, say as <strong>hr80st</strong> and <strong>hr90st</strong>. Next, we compute the spatial lags for these variables using the queen contiguity weights, say <strong>whr80st</strong> and <strong>whr90st</strong>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The relation between <strong>hr90st</strong> and <strong>hr80st</strong> (or, in general, between a variable <span class="math inline">\(y_{i,t}\)</span> and its time lag <span class="math inline">\(y_{i,t-1}\)</span>) yields a highly significant slope of <strong>0.553</strong>, as shown in the standard scatter plot graph below. This suggests a very strong temporal correlation of this variable over time.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics5b/4_535_scat_hr90_hr80.png" alt="Scatter plot hr90 on hr80" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Scatter plot hr90 on hr80
</p>
</div>
<p>Closely related to this temporal correlation is the linear relation between the spatial lags of the crime rate between the two time periods (i.e., a regression of the variable <span class="math inline">\(\sum_j w_{ij} y_{j,t}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\sum_j w_{ij} y_{j,t-1}\)</span>). In some sense, if there is a strong temporal correlation between the variable <em>in-situ</em>, then it is likely that there is also a strong temporal correlation between their neighbors (in the form of their spatial lags). Again, the standard scatter plot yields a strongly significant positive slope of <strong>0.835</strong>, even higher than for the variable in-situ.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics5b/4_537_scatwr90_wr80.png" alt="Scatter plot W_hr90 on W_hr80" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Scatter plot W_hr90 on W_hr80
</p>
</div>
<p>Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, there is no issue with regressing the value of <strong>hr90st</strong> on the spatial lag in 1980 (<strong>whr80st</strong>). Unlike what is the case in the pure cross-sectional situation, where the spatial lag is endogenous, the spatial lag in a <em>different</em> time period is exogenous (in the absence of temporal correlation).</p>
<p>The implication of this is that the ordinary regression estimate of the slope coefficient of <strong>hr90st</strong> on <strong>whr80st</strong> is unbiased. In the standard spatial scatter plot, this yields a slope of <strong>0.804</strong>, again highly significant.</p>
<p>The specification with the value of a variable at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> regressed on the value of its neighbors at time <span class="math inline">\(t - 1\)</span> (formally, a regression of <span class="math inline">\(y_{i,t}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\sum_j w_{ij} y_{j,t-1}\)</span>) is the most natural formulation of a space-time regression, expressing how the values at neighboring locations at the previous time period <em>diffuse</em> to the location at the next time period.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics5b/4_536_scathr90_whr80.png" alt="Scatter plot hr90 on W_hr80" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Scatter plot hr90 on W_hr80
</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, we can include both in-situ correlation and space-time correlation in a regression specification of <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> on both <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,t-1}\)</span> (i.e., <strong>hr80st</strong>) and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_j w_{ij}x_{j,t-1}\)</span> (i.e., <strong>whr80st</strong>). In the absence of temporal error autocorrelation, standard ordinary least squares regression will yield unbiased estimates of the coefficients.</p>
<p>Using the regression functionality of GeoDa (not further considered here), this yields the following result.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics5b/4_534_bivariate_regression.png" alt="Bivariate lag decomposition regression" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Bivariate lag decomposition regression
</p>
</div>
<p>Correcting for both the in-situ correlation and the space-time correlation simultaneously considerably lowers the regression coefficients. In the regression, both effects are highly significant, with a coefficient of <strong>0.384</strong> for the in-situ effect, and <strong>0.442</strong> for the space-time effect.</p>
<p>Needless to say, focusing the analysis solely on the bivariate Moran scatter plot provides only a limited perspective on the complexity of space-time (or, in general, bivariate) spatial and space-time associations.</p>

<h2>Differential Moran Scatter Plot</h2>
<div id="concept" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>An alternative to the bivariate spatial correlation between a variable at one point in time and its neighbors at a previous (or, in general, any different) point in time is to control for the locational <em>fixed effects</em> by diffencing the variable. More precisely, we apply the computation of the spatial autocorrelation statistic to the variable <span class="math inline">\(y_{i,t} - y_{i,t-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This takes care of any temporal correlation that may be the result of a fixed effect (i.e. a set of variables determining the value of <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> that remain unchanged over time). Specifically, if <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span> were a fixed effect associated with location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, we could express the value at each location for time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as the sum of some intrinsic value and the fixed effect, as <span class="math inline">\(y_{i,t} = y*_{i,t} + \mu_i\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span> is unchanged over time (hence, fixed). The presence of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span> induces a <em>temporal</em> correlation between <span class="math inline">\(y_{i,t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_{i,t-1}\)</span>, above and beyond the correlation between <span class="math inline">\(y*_{i,t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y*_{i,t-1}\)</span>. Taking the first difference eliminates the fixed effect and ensures that any remaining correlation is solely due to <span class="math inline">\(y*\)</span>.</p>
<p>A differential Moran’s I is then the slope in a regression of the spatial lag of the difference, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\sum_j w_{ij} (y_{j,t} - y_{j,t-1})\)</span> on the difference <span class="math inline">\((y_{i,t} - y_{i,t-1})\)</span>. All the usual interpretations apply.</p>
</div>
<div id="implementation" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>We start the differential moran scatter plot in the by now familiar way, from the main menu as <strong>Space &gt; Differential Moran’s I</strong>, or from the moran scatter plot toolbar icon, as the third item in the drop down list. Note that this functionality is only available for data sets with <em>grouped</em> variables. If there are no grouped variables present, a warning message will be generated.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics5b/2_525_differential_icon.png" alt="Differential Moran scatter plot icon" width="25%" />
<p class="caption">
Differential Moran scatter plot icon
</p>
</div>
<p>With grouped variables in the data set, selecting the option brings up the variable selection dialog. This contains four drop down lists. The <strong>Select variable</strong> list contains only the <em>grouped</em> variables. In our example, this is <strong>hr</strong>, <strong>hc</strong> and <strong>po</strong>, as shown. The next two drop down lists allow the time periods to be chosen (these correspond to the time labels entered when creating the grouped variables). Finally, the list at the bottom allows for the selection of the spatial weights. In our example, we take <strong>hr</strong> between <strong>90</strong> and <strong>80</strong> with the <strong>natregimes_q</strong> spatial weights.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics5b/2_526_differential_var_setting.png" alt="Differential Moran variable selection" width="60%" />
<p class="caption">
Differential Moran variable selection
</p>
</div>
<p>The result is the familiar plot. The slope is about 0.052, much smaller in magnitude than the bivariate space-time measures obtained so far. However, even with this small value for Moran’s I, the statistic is highly significant. Permutation inference (not shown) with 999 replications yields a pseudo p-value of 0.001 and corresponding z-value of 5.03.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>All the standard Moran scatter plot options also apply to the differential plot. For example, after activating the <strong>View &gt; Regimes Regression</strong> option, we can investigate the difference between regionalized autocorrelation coefficients. In the same manner as we implemented for the standard Moran scatter plot, we can select a subset of observations, such as the counties in the south, and assess the effect on the autocorrelation coefficient. The Moran scatter plot on the left shows the value for the selected observations as 0.080, with the value for the complements as 0.037, compared to the overall coefficient of 0.052. As before, this is purely illustrative and is not associated with a formal test for structural stability.</p>

<p>The option to <strong>Save Results</strong> works in a slightly different fashion from the standard case. In addition to the standardized value (of <span class="math inline">\(y_{i,t} - y_{i,t-1}\)</span>) and its spatial lag, the actual first difference (in unstandardized form) can be saved to the table as well, when the <strong>Diff Value</strong> box is checked.</p>

<h2>Moran Scatter Plot for EB Rates</h2>
<div id="concepts" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Concepts</h3>
<p>An Empirical Bayes (EB) standardization was suggested by <span class="citation">Assuncao and Reis (1999)</span> as a means to correct Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation test statistic for varying population densities across observational units, when the variable of interest is a rate or proportion. This standardization borrows ideas from the Bayesian <em>shrinkage</em> estimator outlined in discussion of Empirical Bayes smoothing.</p>
<p>However, the current approach is different from EB smoothing in that the spatial autocorrelation is not computed for a smoothed version of the original rate, but for a transformed standardized random variable. In other words, the crude rate is turned into a new variable that has a mean of zero and unit variance, thus avoiding problems with variance instability. The mean and variance used in the transformation are computed for each individual observation, thereby properly accounting for the instability in variance.</p>
<p>The technical aspects are given in detail in <span class="citation">Assuncao and Reis (1999)</span> and in the review by <span class="citation">Anselin, Lozano, and Koschinsky (2006)</span>, but we briefly touch upon some salient issues here. The point of departure is the crude rate, say <span class="math inline">\(r_i = O_i / P_i\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(O_i\)</span> is the count of events at location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_i\)</span> is the corresponding population at risk.</p>
<p>The rationale behind the Assuncao-Reis approach is to standardize each <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[z_i = \frac{r_i - \beta}{\sqrt{\alpha + (\beta / P_i)}},\]</span> using an estimated mean <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and standard error <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\alpha + \beta / P_i}\)</span>. The parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are related to the prior distribution for the risk, which we do not consider further.</p>
<p>In practice, these parameters are estimated by means of the so-called method of moments <span class="citation">(e.g., Marshall 1991)</span>, yielding the following expressions: <span class="math display">\[\beta = O / P,\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> as the total event count (<span class="math inline">\(\sum_i O_i\)</span>), and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> as the total population count (<span class="math inline">\(\sum_i P_i\)</span>), and <span class="math display">\[\alpha = [\sum_i P_i ( r_i - \beta )^2 ] / P - \beta / ( P / N),\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> as the total number of observations (in other words, <span class="math inline">\(P/N\)</span> is the average population).</p>
<p>One problem with the method of moments estimator is that the expression for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> could yield a negative result. In that case, its value is typically set to zero, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0\)</span>. However, in <span class="citation">Assuncao and Reis (1999)</span>, the value for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is only set to zero when the resulting estimate for the variance is negative, that is, when <span class="math inline">\(\alpha + \beta / P_i &lt; 0\)</span>. Slight differences in the standardized variates may result depending on the convention used. In GeoDa, when the variance estimate is negative, the original raw rate is used.</p>

<p>The Moran scatter plot for standardized rates is invoked from the main menu as <strong>Space &gt; Moran’s I with EB Rate</strong> as as the fourth item on the Moran scatter plot toolbar icon.</p>

<p>The variable selection dialog follows the same logic as for all rate calculations, with a selection of the <strong>Event Variable</strong> (the numerator) and the <strong>Base Variable</strong>. In our example, with time-enabled variables we can also pick the relevant <strong>Time</strong> periods. At the bottom of the dialog is the selection of the spatial weights. In our example, we choose the homicide count in 1960 (<strong>hc(60)</strong>) as the numerator and the population (<strong>po(60)</strong>) as the denominator, with <strong>natregimes_q</strong> as the weights.</p>

<p>This yields a Moran scatter plot. The axes labels show the numerator and denominator of the rates for which the statistic was computed. In our example, the result is a spatial autocorrelation coefficient of 0.518. Using permutation inference (not shown) with 999 permutations yields a pseudo p-value of 0.001 with an associated z-value of 48.7. All standard options for the Moran scatter plot apply (and will not be reviewed).</p>

<p>For comparison purposes, we also compute Moran’s I for the crude rate, <strong>hr(60)</strong> (using the same queen contiguity spatial weights).</p>

<p>The result is a spatial autocorrelation coefficient of 0.369, quite a bit lower in absolute magnitude. This coefficient is also highly significant at 0.001 with a z-value of 33.7. However, this inference may be somewhat misleading since it ignores the intrinsic variance instability of the rates. In a strict sense, the Moran’s I test for spatial autocorrelation is based on an assumption of a constant mean (obtained by de-meaning the variables) <em>and</em> a constant variance. The latter is violated in the case of rates. The EBI transformation ensures that this does not affect the resulting inference. <br></p>
