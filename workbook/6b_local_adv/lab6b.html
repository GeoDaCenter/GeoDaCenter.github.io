      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In this chapter, we continue our exploration of local spatial autocorrelation statistics. First,
        we cover several extensions of the Local Moran, such as the Median Local Moran, the Differential
        Local Moran and a specialized version that deals with the variance instability in rates or
        proportions, the EB Local Moran. In addition, we discuss the Local Geary statistic. We also
        cover a local statistics introduced by Getis and Ord. These statistics are not a LISA in a strict sense,
        but nevertheless are important tools to discover local hot spots and cold spots.</p>
      <p>We use two of the example data sets we introduced earlier, the <strong>natregimes</strong> data on homicides
        in U.S. counties and the <strong>Guerry</strong> collection of socio-economic indicators for 1830 France.</p>

        <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
        <p>We will alternately use the <strong>Guerry</strong> data set and the <strong>natregimes</strong> data set.
          For each of
          these, we need an active spatial weights matrix, e.g., <strong>guerry_85_q</strong> for the former and
          <strong>natregimes_q</strong> for
          the latter. See the description in earlier Chapters on how to accomplish this.</p>
        <p>For the <strong>natregimes</strong> data set, we need some further preparation to make the variables time
          sensitive.
          By means
          of the <strong>Time Editor</strong>, we first group the homicide rates <strong>hr60</strong> through
          <strong>hr90</strong>
          into the variable <strong>hr</strong>, the homicide counts <strong>hc60</strong> through <strong>hc90</strong>
          into the
          variable <strong>hc</strong>, and the population counts <strong>po60</strong> through <strong>po90</strong>
          into <strong>po</strong>.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="extensions-of-the-local-moran" class="section level2 unnumbered" number="">
      <h2>Extensions of the Local Moran</h2>
      <p>We consider three extensions of the Local Moran. One uses the median of the neighboring values instead of the
        average in the computation of the local statistic. We refer to it as the <em>Median Local Moran</em>. A second
        extension provides an easy way to compute the Local Moran for the difference for a given variable at two points
        in time. The <em>Differential Local Moran</em> is equivalent to first computing the difference and then applying
        the Local Moran, but our
        implementation carries everything out in one step. Finally, we consider an adjustment to the Local Moran for the
        inherent variance instability of rates in the form of the <em>EB Local Moran</em>.</p>
      <p>These extensions can be found among the first group in the <strong>Space</strong> item on the Menu, or in the
        corresponding
        drop down list obtained from the toolbar icon. For example, Figure <a href="#fig:lisaplus">1</a> shows the
        selection
        of the <em>Median Local Moran</em>.</p>

        <h3>Median Local Moran</h3>
        <div id="principle" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Principle</h4>
          <p>So far, we have defined a spatially lagged variable as <span class="math inline">\(\sum_j w_{ij}
              z_j\)</span>, or the average of the values observed
            at the neighboring locations. As we saw in the discussion of the interpretation of the clusters and outliers
            identified by a significant Local Moran, the spatial lag is sensitive to the presence of outliers. This may
            pull
            the average up (or down), even when many of the neighbors do not have high (low) values, creating a
            potentially misleading impression
            of a cluster or outlier.</p>
          <p>An alternative can be based loosely on the idea of a <em>median smoother</em> <span class="citation">(e.g.,
              Wall and Devine <a href="#ref-WallDevine:00" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>. In the latter, the
            value at a location (typically a rate) is replaced by the median of the neighboring locations.
            In the interpretation
            here, the median of the neighbors is used <em>in the place of</em> the average as a <em>median spatial
              lag</em>.</p>
          <p>Consequently,
            the Median Local Moran becomes:
            <span class="math display">\[I_{i}^M = z_i \times \mbox{med}(z_j, j \in N_i),\]</span>
            where <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span> is the neighbor set of location <span
              class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (i.e., those locations for which <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij} \neq
              0\)</span>).
          </p>
          <p>Inference and interpretation are identical to that for the original Local Moran.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="implementation" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Implementation</h4>
          <p>As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:lisaplus">1</a>, the Median Local Moran is invoked as the second item
            in first group of the <strong>Cluster Maps</strong> drop down list from the toolbar, or as
            <strong>Space &gt; Univariate Median Local Moran’s I</strong> from the menu.
          </p>
          <p>This brings up the usual variable selection dialog, as we saw in the previous Chapter.
            All the options are the same as for the Local Moran, i.e., the randomization, significance filter
            and saving of the results. We refer to that discussion for details.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="comparing-local-moran-to-median-local-moran" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Comparing Local Moran to Median Local Moran</h4>
          <p>To compare the results between the traditional Local Moran and the more robust Median Local Moran,
            we put the respective significance maps and cluster maps side by side. We use the <strong>Guerry</strong>
            data set
            with the <strong>Donatns</strong> variable in this
            illustration.</p>
          <p>In Figure <a href="#fig:medlisasig">2</a>, we have the significance map for the Median Local Moran on the
            left, compared
            to the traditional Local Moran on the right. Both results are for 99,999 random permutations and use p=0.05
            as the
            significance level, with queen contiguity as the spatial weights.</p>
          <p>The Median Local Moran has slightly fewer significant locations, with 25 compared to 29 for the traditional
            Local Moran.
            Also, there is no longer a location that achieves a p-value of 0.0001. The changes work in both directions.
            Several locations that are significant for the Local Moran are no longer significant in the median version.
            However, especially
            in the group of locations in the center-west, there are a small number of newly significant locations.</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:medlisasig"></span>
            <img src="pics6b/11_median_sig.png" alt="Significance maps for Local Moran and Median Local Moran"
              width="80%" />
            <p class="caption">
              Figure 2: Significance maps for Local Moran and Median Local Moran

          </div>
          <p>The respective cluster maps are compared side by side in Figure <a href="#fig:medlisacluster">3</a>, with
            again the results for
            the Median Local Moran in the left panel. Now, we see more clearly what is going on. The main effect seems
            to be on the
            former spatial outliers (one High-Low and one Low-High), which are no longer significant. Recall the
            discussion in the previous Chapter about the potential leverage effect of some outliers. Using the median
            spatial lag effectively removes that influence. One of the spatial outliers remains significant however,
            strengthening our identification of that observation
            as an <em>interesting</em> location. The main effect on the clusters is a shrinkage of the number of Low-Low
            observations and
            an increase in the size of the center-west High-High cluster.</p>

          <p>Overall, a comparison of the results for the Median Local Moran to the traditional Local Moran provides
            insight into
            the sensitivity of the results to potential outliers. It should be part of a standard sensitivity analysis,
            together
            with an assessment of different p-value cut-offs.</p>

        <h3>Differential Local Moran</h3>
        <div id="principle-1" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Principle</h4>
          <p>The Differential Local Moran statistic is the local counterpart to the differential Moran scatter plot,
            discussed in an earlier Chapter. Instead of using the observations on a variable at two different time
            periods separately, this statistic is based on the change over time, i.e., the difference between <span
              class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_{t-1}\)</span>. Note that this is the
            actual difference and not the absolute difference, so that a positive change will be viewed as
            <em>high</em>, and a negative change as <em>low</em>. The differences are used in standardized form, i.e.,
            they are not the differences between the standardized variable at two points in time, but the standardized
            differences between the original values for the variable.</p>
          <p>The formal expression for this statistic follows the same logic as before, and
            consists of the cross product of the difference between <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> and <span
              class="math inline">\(y_{t-1}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with the associated
            spatial lag:</p>
          <p><span class="math display">\[I_{i}^D = c (y_{i,t} - y_{i,t-1}) \sum_j w_{ij} (y_{j,t} -
              y_{j,t-1}).\]</span>
            The scaling constant <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> can be ignored. In essence, this is the same as
            the traditional Local Moran applied
            to the difference, but our implementation is based on selecting the two variables separately.</p>
          <p>As before, inference is based on conditional permutation. All the usual caveats hold about multiple
            comparisons and the choice of a p-value. In all respects, the interpretation is the same as for the
            traditional Local Moran.</p>

          <p>In order to provide some reference, we first create a traditional Local Moran cluster map for
            the variable <strong>hr</strong> in <strong>90</strong> in the time enabled <strong>natregimes</strong> data
            set
            (see <a href="#preliminaries">Preliminaries</a>). The result, for the default of 999 permutations and p=0.05
            is shown in
            Figure <a href="#fig:hrlisamap">4</a>.</p>

              Figure 4: Local Moran cluster map for hr(90)
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>The differential local Moran functionality is invoked from the <strong>Cluster Maps</strong> toolbar icon,
            as
            shown in Figure <a href="#fig:lisaplus">1</a>, or from the menu as <strong>Space &gt; Differential Local
              Moran’s I</strong>.</p>
          <p>Next follows a variable selection dialog, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:difflisavars">5</a>, which is
            slightly different from the standard interface,
            but the same as for the differential Moran scatter plot.</p>
          <p>First, the variable of interest is selected
            (here, <strong>hr</strong>), and then the two time periods are chosen (here, <strong>90</strong> and
            <strong>80</strong>).
            Note that the system is agnostic about the actual time periods, so that any combination can be selected. The
            statistic is computed for the difference between the time period specified as the first item and that given
            as the second item. In our
            example, the spatial weights are <strong>natregime_q</strong>.</p>

          <p>As before, a choice is presented between a <strong>Significance Map</strong>, <strong>Cluster Map</strong>,
            and <strong>Moran Scatter Plot</strong>, with just the <strong>Cluster Map</strong> selected as the default.
            With the default setting, the result is based on 999 permutations with a p-value of 0.05, as shown in Figure
            <a href="#fig:difflisamap">6</a>.</p>

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>All the options, such as randomization and significance filter are the same as for the univariate local
            Moran and will not be further discussed here. There is a slight difference in how the results are saved,
            which is illustrated below.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="interpretation" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Interpretation</h4>
          <p>The first aspect of the results is a much smaller number of significant locations compared to the standard
            cluster map (compare to Figure <a href="#fig:hrlisamap">4</a>). The result here gives the locations where
            the change in the variable over time is matched by similar/dissimilar changes in the surrounding locations.
            It is important to keep in mind that the focus is on change, and there is no direct connection to whether
            this changes is from high or from low values.</p>
          <p>Two situations can be distinguished, depending on whether the change variable takes on both positive and
            negative values, or when all the changes are of the same sign (i.e., all observations either increase or
            decrease over time).</p>
          <p>When both positive and negative change values are present, the <em>High-High</em> locations will tend to be
            locations with a large increase (positive change), surrounded by locations with similar large increases. The
            <em>Low-Low</em> locations will be observations with a large decrease (negative change), surrounded by
            locations with similar large decreases. Spatial outliers will be locations where an increase is surrounded
            by a decrease and vice versa.</p>
          <p>When all changes are of the same sign, the interpretation of High-High and Low-Low depends on the sign. Due
            to the standardization, large positive values will be considered <em>high</em> (above the mean), whereas
            large negative values will be labeled <em>low</em> (below the mean). This should be kept in mind when
            interpreting the results.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="saving-the-results" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Saving the results</h4>
          <p>Similar to the functionality for the differential Moran scatter plot, the <strong>Save Results</strong>
            option includes an item to save the actual change variable (in raw form, not in standardized form). In the
            dialog, this corresponds to the <strong>Diff Values</strong> item, as shown in Figure <a
              href="#fig:difflisaresults">7</a>. The other options are the same as for all local spatial autocorrelation
            statistics, i.e., the value of the statistic, cluster type, and p-value.</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:difflisaresults"></span>
            <img src="pics6b/00_2_save_results.png" alt="Saving the results for differential local Moran" width="25%" />

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>Once the difference is saved as a separate variable, it can be used in a standard univariate Local Moran
            operation.</p>

        <h3>Local Moran with EB Rate</h3>
        <div id="principle-2" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Principle</h4>
          <p>The last of the extensions of the local Moran’s I pertains to the special case where the variable of
            interest is a rate or proportion. As discussed for the Moran scatter plot, the resulting variance
            instability can cause problems for the Moran statistic. The EB standardization suggested by <span
              class="citation">Assunção and Reis (<a href="#ref-AssuncaoReis:99" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span>
            for the global case can be extended to the local statistic in a straightforward manner. The statistic has
            the usual form, but is computed for the standardized rates, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.</p>
          <p><span class="math display">\[I_{i}^{EB} = c z_i \sum_j w_{ij} z_j,\]</span></p>
          <p>The standardization of the raw rate <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> is the same as before, and is
            repeated here for completeness (for a more detailed discussion, see the relevant Chapter):</p>
          <p><span class="math display">\[z_i = \frac{r_i - \beta}{\sqrt{\alpha + (\beta/P_i)}}\]</span>
            with <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> as an estimate of the mean and the denominator as an
            estimate of the standard error.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
          <p>All inference and interpretation is the same as for the univariate case and is not further pursued here.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="implementation-and-interpretation" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Implementation and interpretation</h4>
          <p>The local Moran functionality for standardized rates is invoked as the last item in the Moran group on the
            <strong>Cluster Maps</strong> toolbar icon, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:lisaplus">1</a>. Alternatively, it
            can be selected from the
            menu as <strong>Space &gt; Local Moran’s I with EB Rate</strong>.</p>
          <p>Since the rate standardization is computed as part of the operation, the variable selection interface is
            similar to that used for rate maps. With the time enabled variables, we need to make sure the
            <strong>Time</strong> is synchronized so that both the numerator (the events) and the denominator (the
            population at risk) pertain to the same period (here, <strong>90</strong>). In our example, shown in Figure
            <a href="#fig:eblisavars">8</a>,
            we take the <strong>Event Variable</strong> as homicide counts, <strong>hc(90)</strong>, and the
            <strong>Base Variable</strong> as population, <strong>po(90)</strong>. As before, we use the queen
            contiguity, <strong>natregimes_q</strong>.</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:eblisavars"></span>

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>Again, we can choose between a <strong>Significance Map</strong>, a <strong>Cluster Map</strong> and the
            <strong>Moran Scatter Plot</strong> options. With the default settings (cluster map, 999 permutations and p
            = 0.05), the resulting map is as in
            Figure <a href="#fig:eblisamap">9</a>.</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:eblisamap"></span>

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>Compared to the cluster map for the raw rates in Figure <a href="#fig:hrlisamap">4</a>, we observe major
            differences in the Low-Low clusters in the upper midwest. Typically, the greater the variation among values
            for the base variable (population at risk), especially when the latter is small, the more the two maps will
            tend to differ. However, when the base population is more or less equal by design (e.g., for census tracts
            in the U.S.), there is little gain from using the EB rates.</p>

          <h4>Saving the results</h4>
          <p>Here again, the <strong>Save Results</strong> option includes an item to save the actual EB rate (this is
            identical to the EB Rate standardization that can be computed with the <strong>Table Calculator</strong>
            option). In the dialog, this corresponds to the <strong>EB Rates</strong> item, as shown in Figure <a
              href="#fig:eblisaresults">10</a>. The other options are the same as for all local spatial autocorrelation
            statistics, i.e., the value of the statistic, cluster type, and p-value.</p>

    <div id="local-geary" class="section level2 unnumbered" number="">
      <h2>Local Geary</h2>
      <div id="principle-3" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Principle</h3>
        <p>The Local Geary statistic, first outlined in <span class="citation">Anselin (<a href="#ref-Anselin:95"
              role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>, and further elaborated upon
          in <span class="citation">Anselin (<a href="#ref-Anselin:18" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, is a Local
          Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) that uses a
          different measure of attribute similarity. As in its global counterpart, the focus
          is on squared differences, or, rather, <em>dissimilarity</em>. In other words, small values
          of the statistics suggest positive spatial autocorrelation, whereas large values suggest negative spatial
          autocorrelation.</p>
        <p>The Geary c statistic of spatial autocorrelation <span class="citation">(Geary <a href="#ref-Geary:54"
              role="doc-biblioref">1954</a>)</span> takes on the following form:
          <span class="math display">\[c = \frac{\sum_i \sum_j w_{ij}(x_i - x_j)^2/2S_0}{\sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})^2 /
            (n-1)},\]</span>
          with <span class="math inline">\(S_0 = \sum_i \sum_j w_{ij}\)</span>, and where the <span
            class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the numerator do not need to be in standardized form, due to the squared
          difference.
          The statistic has a mean value of 1 under the null hypothesis of spatial randomness. Significant values less
          than
          1 indicate positive spatial autocorrelation and values larger than 1 negative spatial autocorrelation.
        </p>
        <p>After controlling for the parts in the expression that do not change with <span
            class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, a local version of
          the statistic can be found as <span class="citation">(for technical details, see Anselin <a
              href="#ref-Anselin:95" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>:
          <span class="math display">\[LG_i = \sum_j w_{ij}(x_i - x_j)^2,\]</span>
          in the usual notation. Again, because of the squared difference, there is no need to standardize <span
            class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Closer examination reveals that this statistic consists of a weighted sum of the squared distance in
          attribute
          space for the geographical neighbors of observation <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Since there is no
          cross-product involved, there
          is no direct relation to <em>linear</em> similarity. In other words, since the Local Geary uses a different
          criterion of attribute similarity, it may detect patterns that escape the Local Moran, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>As for the Local Moran, analytical inference is based on an approximation and generally not very reliable.
          Instead, the same conditional permutation procedure as for the Local Moran is implemented.
          The results are interpreted in the
          same way, with the caveat regarding the p-values and the notion of significance.</p>
        <div id="clusters-and-spatial-outliers" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Clusters and spatial outliers</h4>
          <p>The interpretation of significant
            locations in terms of the type of association is not as straightforward for the Local Geary as
            it was for the Local Moran. In essence, this
            is because the attribute similarity is not a cross-product and thus has no direct
            correspondence with the slope in a scatter plot. Nevertheless, we can use the linking
            capability within <code>GeoDa</code> to make an incomplete classification.</p>
          <p>Those locations identified
            as significant and with the Local Geary statistic smaller than its mean, suggest positive
            spatial autocorrelation (small differences imply similarity). For those observations that
            can be classified in the upper-right or lower-left quadrants of a matching Moran scatter
            plot, we can identify the association as High-High or Low-Low. However, given that
            the squared difference can cross the mean, there may be observations for which such a
            classification is not possible. We will refer to those as <em>other</em> positive spatial autocorrelation.
          </p>
          <p>For negative spatial autocorrelation (large values imply dissimilarity), it is not possible
            to assess whether the association is between High-Low or Low-High outliers, since the
            squaring of the differences removes the sign.</p>
          <p>We will illustrate this further below.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="implementation-2" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>We return to using the <strong>Guerry</strong> data set for our illustration.</p>
        <p>In the same way as for the Local Moran, the Local Geary can be invoked from the <strong>Cluster Maps</strong>
          toolbar icon, as
          the first item in the fourth block in Figure <a href="#fig:lisaplus">1</a>. Alternatively,
          it can be started from the main menu, as
          <strong>Space &gt; Univariate Local Geary</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>The subsequent step is the same as before, bringing up the <strong>Variable Settings</strong> dialog that
          contains the names of the available variables as well as the spatial weights. Everything
          operates in the same way for all local statistics, so we will not dwell on those aspects here.
          We again select <strong>Donatns</strong> as the variable, with <strong>guerry_85_q</strong> as the queen
          contiguity
          weights.</p>
        <p>The following dialog offering different window options is slightly different, in that there is no Moran
          scatter plot option. The
          only options are for the <strong>Significance Map</strong> and the <strong>Cluster Map</strong>. The default
          is that
          only the latter is checked, as in Figure <a href="#fig:localgearywindows">11</a>.</p>

        <p>After selecting the <strong>Significance Map</strong> option as well, the OK button generates two maps, using
          a default p-value of 0.05 and 999 permutations,
          as shown in Figures <a href="#fig:localgearysig05">12</a> and <a href="#fig:localgearyclust05">13</a>. In our
          example, there are 28 significant locations, highlighted in Figure <a href="#fig:localgearysig05">12</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p>As discussed above, some of the locations with a positive spatial autocorrelation can
          be distinguished between the High-High and Low-Low cases. As shown
          in Figure <a href="#fig:localgearyclust05">13</a>, there are
          9 such High-High locations and 17 Low-Low locations. There are no locations with
          positive spatial autocorrelation classified as <em>other</em> in this case. There are two
          observations with negative spatial autocorrelation, although, as discussed, it is not
          possible to characterize the type of spatial outliers they correspond with.</p>

        <p>All the options operate the same for all local statistics, including the randomization
          setting, the selection of significance levels, the selection of cores and neighbors,
          the conditional map option, as well as
          the standard operations of setting the selection shape and saving the image.</p>

        <h3>Interpretation and significance</h3>
        <p>Before proceeding further, we change the randomization option to 99,999 permutations. This
          results in minor changes in the cluster map, with two of the marginal (i.e., only significant
          at p &lt; 0.05) Low-Low locations removed. As a result, there are now 26 significant locations.</p>
        <div id="clusters-and-spatial-outliers-1" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Clusters and spatial outliers</h4>
          <p>To illustrate the rationale behind the classification of the local clusters, we link the
            locations identified as High-High with a matching Moran scatter plot. As usual, we
            select the observations in question by clicking on the red rectangle in the legend
            next to High-High. This highlights the corresponding locations in the cluster map (the other
            locations become more transparent) and simultaneously selects the matching points in the
            Moran scatter plot. As illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:localgearyhihi">14</a>, the type of association
            is between locations above the
            mean and a spatial lag that is also above the mean, which we have characterized as High-High.</p>

          <p>In our example, all cluster locations can be classified by means of the Moran scatter plot.
            However, typically, this is not the case and some observations have to be classified as <em>other</em>.
            Those are locations surrounded by neighbors that are similar (small squared difference), but
            they may be located on different sides of the mean (e.g., a value slightly above the mean and
            a neighbor slightly below the mean).</p>
          <p>For negative spatial autocorrelation, there is no unambiguous classification, since the
            squared differences eliminate the sign of the dissimilarity between an observation
            and its neighbors. The corresponding points in the Moran scatter plot are not informative,
            as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:localgearyneg">16</a>.</p>

          <h4>Changing the significance threshold</h4>
          <p>With 99,999 permutations, the significance map allows for a much finer grained
            assessment of significance. In our example, in Figure <a href="#fig:localgearysig0001">17</a>, 14 locations
            are significant at 0.05,
            10 at 0.01, and one each for 0.001 and 0.00001. Note that there is some
            correspondence between the Local Moran and the Local Geary cluster maps, but there is
            by no means a perfect match. Specifically, while the most significant locations are
            in the same region (the South of France), the location with p &lt; 0.00001 found here is
            not the same as the one identified for the Local Moran, but a neighbor.</p>

          <p>In the same way as for the Local Moran statistic, we can manipulate the
            <strong>Significance Filter</strong> to assess the sensitivity of the identified clusters and spatial
            outliers to the choice of the cut-off point. For example, in Figure <a href="#fig:localgearyclus01">18</a>,
            with p &lt; 0.01, there are six
            High-High and six Low-Low cluster cores, but there is no longer any evidence of spatial outliers.

      <h2>Getis-Ord Statistics</h2>
      <div id="principle-4" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Principle</h3>
        <p>An early class of statistics for local spatial autocorrelation was suggested by
          <span class="citation">Getis and Ord (<a href="#ref-GetisOrd:92" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span>, and
          further elaborated upon in <span class="citation">Ord and Getis (<a href="#ref-OrdGetis:95"
              role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>. It is derived from a
          point pattern analysis logic. In its earliest formulation the statistic consisted of a ratio of
          the number of observations within a given range of a point to the total count of points. In a more general
          form, the statistic is applied to the values at neighboring locations (as defined
          by the spatial weights). There are two versions of the statistic. They differ in that
          one takes the value at the given location into account, and the other does not.
        </p>
        <p>The <span class="math inline">\(G_i\)</span> statistic consist of a ratio of the weighted average of the
          values in the neighboring locations, to the sum of all values, <strong>not including the value at the
            location</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>).
          <span class="math display">\[G_i = \frac{\sum_{j \neq i} w_{ij} x_j}{\sum_{j \neq i} x_j}\]</span>
        </p>
        <p>In contrast, the <span class="math inline">\(G_i^*\)</span> statistic includes the value <span
            class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> in both numerator and denominator:
          <span class="math display">\[G_i^* = \frac{\sum_j w_{ij} x_j}{\sum_j x_j}.\]</span>
          Note that in this case, the denominator is constant across all observations and simply
          consists of the total sum of all values in the data set. The statistic is the ratio of the average
          values in a window centered on an observation to the total sum of observations.
        </p>
        <p>The interpretation of the Getis-Ord statistics is very straightforward: a value larger than the mean (or, a
          positive value for a standardized z-value) suggests a High-High cluster or hot spot, a value smaller than the
          mean (or, negative for a z-value) indicates a Low-Low cluster or cold spot. In contrast to the Local Moran and
          Local Geary statistics, the Getis-Ord approach does not consider
          spatial outliers.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
        <p>Inference can be derived from an analytical approximation, as given in <span class="citation">Getis and Ord
            (<a href="#ref-GetisOrd:92" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Ord and Getis
            (<a href="#ref-OrdGetis:95" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>.
          However, as for the Local Moran and Local Geary, such approximation may not be reliable in practice.
          Instead, conditional random permutation can be employed,
          using an identical
          procedure as for the other statistics.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="implementation-3" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The implementation of the Getis-Ord statistics is largely identical to that of the
          other local statistics. Each statistic an be selected from the second group in the drop down menu
          generated by the <strong>Cluster Maps</strong> toolbar icon. Alternatively, they can be invoked from the
          menu as
          <strong>Space &gt; Local G</strong> or <strong>Space &gt; Local G*</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>The next step brings up the <strong>Variable Settings</strong> dialog. We continue with the
          <strong>Guerry</strong> example and again select <strong>Donatns</strong> as the variable, with
          <strong>guerry_85_q</strong> as the queen contiguity
          weights.
        </p>
        <p>This is followed by a choice of windows to be
          opened. The latter is again slightly different from the previous cases. The default,
          shown in Figure <a href="#fig:localgwindows">21</a>, is to <strong>use row-standardized weights</strong>
          and to generate only the <strong>Cluster Map</strong>. The <strong>Significance Map</strong> option needs to
          be invoked explicitly
          by checking the corresponding box.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:localgwindows"></span>

            Figure 21: Getis-Ord statistics window options
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>The Getis-Ord statistics also allow the use of binary weights (i.e., not row-standardized), by
          having the <strong>row-standardized weights</strong> box unchecked. In
          practice, the results rarely differ much.</p>
        <p>Using the default settings of 999 permutations, with p at 0.05, yields the significance
          map for the <span class="math inline">\(G_i\)</span> statistic shown in Figure <a
            href="#fig:gisigmap05">22</a>.</p>

        <p>The corresponding cluster map, illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:giclusmap05">23</a>, shows 10 High-High
          cluster cores or hot spots (in red on the map),
          and 19 Low-Low cluster cores or cold spots (in blue on the map). Note that these are
          the exact same locations as identified for the Local Moran, except that the spatial
          outliers are now classified as part of the clusters (one in the High-High group
          and one in the Low-Low group).</p>

        <h3>Interpretation and significance</h3>
        <p>In the same way as for the other statistics, changing the number of permutations to 99,999 provides a
          more detailed insight into the importance of the different locations, as indicated
          in the significance map. While 21 locations are deemed to be significant for 0.05, there
          are only four such locations for 0.01, three for 0.001 and one for 0.00001. This is the exact
          same result as for the Local Moran, illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:gisig0001">25</a> for the <span
            class="math inline">\(G_i\)</span> statistic (the
          results for the <span class="math inline">\(G_i^*\)</span> statistic are the same).</p>

        <p>Using the <strong>Significance Filter</strong>, we can assess the effect of a change of critical p-value to
          0.01. In Figure <a href="#fig:giclus01">26</a>, only one High-High cluster core remains, whereas the Low-Low

          <p>When all observations for a variable are positive, as is
            the case in our examples, the G statistics are positive ratios less than one. Large ratios (more precisely,
            less small values since all ratios are small)
            correspond with High-High hot spots, small ratios with Low-Low cold spots.<a href="#fnref3"
