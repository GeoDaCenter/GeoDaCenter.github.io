# Responsive Navbar Fix - Search and Language Switcher Overlap

## Problem
The search component (Algolia DocSearch) was overlapping with the language switcher button when the page was resized to smaller widths, causing usability issues on mobile devices and smaller screens.

## Root Cause
The navbar items were not properly configured for responsive behavior, and the language switcher was being injected into the navbar without proper spacing and responsive design considerations.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive responsive CSS and component updates to ensure proper spacing and layout across all screen sizes.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Updated `src/css/custom.css`**
Added responsive navbar styles with proper spacing and layout:

```css
/* Fix search and language switcher overlap */
.navbar__items--right {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

/* Ensure proper spacing between search and language switcher */
.navbar__item {
  margin-left: 8px;
}

/* Language switcher specific styles */
.global-language-switcher {
  margin-left: 8px !important;
  z-index: 1001;
}

/* DocSearch container styles */
.DocSearch-Button {
  margin-right: 8px;
}
```

#### 2. **Responsive Breakpoints**

**Medium screens (≤768px):**
- Reduced spacing between items
- Made language switcher more compact
- Adjusted font sizes

**Small screens (≤480px):**
- Stacked items vertically
- Hidden "Language" text, showing only globe icon
- Made search button smaller
- Ensured dropdown positioning

#### 3. **Updated `src/components/GlobalLanguageSwitcher.tsx`**
- Reduced default margin from 16px to 8px
- Added `flexShrink: '0'` to prevent compression

#### 4. **Updated `src/components/StandaloneLanguageSwitcher.tsx`**
- Added `whiteSpace: 'nowrap'` and `minWidth: 'fit-content'`
- Wrapped "Language" text in a span for responsive hiding
- Improved button styling for better responsive behavior

### Responsive Behavior
