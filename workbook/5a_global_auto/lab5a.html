        <div id="morans-i" class="section level4 unnumbered">
          <h4>Moran’s I</h4>
          <p>Moran’s I statistic is arguably the most commonly used indicator of global spatial autocorrelation.
            It was initially suggested by <span class="citation">Moran (<a href="#ref-Moran:48"
                role="doc-biblioref">1948</a>)</span>, and popularized through the classic work
            on spatial autocorrelation by <span class="citation">Cliff and Ord (<a href="#ref-CliffOrd:73"
                role="doc-biblioref">1973</a>)</span>. In essence, it is a
            cross-product statistic between a variable and its spatial lag, with the
            variable expressed in deviations from its mean. For an observation at location
            <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, this is expressed as <span class="math inline">\(z_i = x_i -
              \bar{x}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is the mean of variable <span
              class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.
          </p>
          <p>Moran’s I
            statistic is then:
            <span class="math display">\[I = \frac{\sum_i\sum_j w_{ij} z_i.z_j /S_0}{\sum_i z_i^2 / n} \]</span>
            with <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij}\)</span> as the elements of the spatial weights matrix, <span
              class="math inline">\(S_0 = \sum_i \sum_j w_{ij}\)</span> as
            the sum of all the weights, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as the number of observations.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="permutation-inference" class="section level4 unnumbered">
          <h4>Permutation inference</h4>
          <p>Inference for Moran’s I is based on a null hypothesis of spatial randomness. The distribution
            of the statistic under the null can be
            derived using either an assumption of normality (independent normal random variates), or
            so-called randomization (i.e., each value is equally likely to occur at any
            location). While the analytical derivations provide easy to interpret expressions for
            the mean and the variance of the statistic under the null hypothesis, inference
            based on them employs an approximation to a standard normal distribution, which
            may be inappropriate when the underlying assumptions are not satisfied.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
              id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
          <p>An alternative to the analytical derivation is a computational approach based on
            <em>permutation</em>. This calculates a reference distribution for the statistic under the null
            hypothesis of spatial randomness by randomly permuting the observed values over the locations.
            The statistic is computed for each of these randomly reshuffled data sets, which yields a
            <em>reference distribution</em>. This approach is not sensitive to potential violations of underlying
            assumptions, and is thus more robust, although limited in generality to the actual sample.
          </p>
          <p>The reference distribution is used to calculate a
            so-called pseudo p-value. This is found as
            <span class="math display">\[p = \frac{R+1}{M+1},\]</span>
            where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the number of times the computed Moran’s I from the spatial
            random
            data sets (the permuted data sets) is equal to or more extreme than the observed
            statistic. <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> equals the number of permutations. The latter
            is typically taken as 99, 999, etc., to yield nicely rounded pseudo p-values.
          </p>
          <p>The pseudo p-value is only a <em>summary</em> of
            the results from the reference distribution and should <em>not</em> be interpreted as an
            analytical p-value. Most importantly, it should be kept in mind that the extent
            of <em>significance</em> is determined in part by the number of random pemutations. More
            precisely, a result that has a p-value of 0.01 with 99 permutations is not necessarily
            more significant than a result with a p-value of 0.001 with 999 permutations.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="moran-scatter-plot" class="section level4 unnumbered">
          <h4>Moran scatter plot</h4>
          <p>The Moran scatter plot, first outlined in <span class="citation">Anselin (<a href="#ref-Anselin:96"
                role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>, consists of a plot with the
            spatially lagged variable on the y-axis and the original variable on the x-axis.
            The slope of the linear fit to the scatter plot equals Moran’s I.</p>
          <p>We consider a variable <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, given in deviations from the mean. With
            row-standardized weights, the sum
            of all the weights (<span class="math inline">\(S_0\)</span>) equals the number of obsevations (<span
              class="math inline">\(n\)</span>). As a result,
            the expression for Moran’s I simplifies to:
            <span class="math display">\[I = \frac{\sum_i\sum_j w_{ij} z_i.z_j}{\sum_i z_i^2} = \frac{\sum_i (z_i \times
              \sum_j w_{ij} z_j)}{\sum_i z_i^2}. \]</span>
            Upon closer examination, this turns out to be the slope
            of a regression of <span class="math inline">\(\sum_j w_{ij}z_j\)</span> on <span
              class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This
            is the
            principle underlying the Moran scatter plot.
          </p>
          <p>An important aspect of the visualization in the Moran scatter plot is the
            classification of the <em>nature</em> of spatial autocorrelation into four categories.
            Since the plot is centered on the mean (of zero), all points to the right of the mean
            have <span class="math inline">\(z_i &gt; 0\)</span> and all points to the left have <span
              class="math inline">\(z_i &lt; 0\)</span>. We refer to these values
            respectively as <em>high</em> and <em>low</em>, in the limited sense of higher or lower than average.
            Similarly, we can classify the values for the spatial lag above and below the mean
            as <em>high</em> and <em>low</em>.</p>
          <p>The scatter plot is then easily decomposed into four quadrants. The upper-right quadrant
            and the lower-left quadrant correspond with <em>positive</em> spatial autocorrelation (similar values
            at neighboring locations). We refer to them as respectively <em>high-high</em> and <em>low-low</em>
            spatial autocorrelation. In contrast, the lower-right and upper-left quadrant correspond to
            <em>negative</em> spatial autocorrelation (dissimilar values at neighboring locations). We refer to them
            as respectively <em>high-low</em> and <em>low-high</em> spatial autocorrelation.
          </p>
          <p>The classification of the spatial autocorrelation into four types begins to make the
            connection between <em>global</em> and <em>local</em> spatial autocorrelation. However, it is important
            to keep in mind that the classification as such does not imply significance. This is
            further explored in our discussion of local indicators of spatial association (LISA).</p>

        <h3>Creating a Moran scatter plot</h3>
        <p>To start the Moran scatter plot, we select the left-most button in the spatial analysis group

        <p>After selecting the toolbar icon, the next prompt is for the type of analysis. For now,
          we will stick to the <strong>Univariate Moran’s I</strong> option, first in the list shown
          in Figure <a href="#fig:unimoranoption">2</a>. Alternatively, we can choose <strong>Space &gt; Univariate

        </div>
        <div id="interpretation" class="section level4 unnumbered">
          <h4>Interpretation</h4>
          <p>In the Moran scatter plot in Figure <a href="#fig:morscatplot">4</a>, the points in the graph are a bit
            lopsided, because it is rendered as a square (the preferred approach when both axes are measured in the same
            units, to avoid distorting the data). The house prices are on the horizontal axis, and their spatially
            lagged counterparts on the vertical axis. Note that the house price values have been standardized, and are
            given in standard deviational units (the mean is zero and the standard deviation is one). Similarly, the
            spatial lag is computed for those standardized values.</p>
          <p>In its default setting, the plot shows a linear fit through the point cloud. The slope of this line
            corresponds to Moran’s I, and its value (0.282) is listed at the top of the graph.</p>
          <p>We can see that the shape of the point cloud is influenced by the presence of several outliers on the high
            end (e.g., larger than three standard deviational units from the mean). One observation, with a sales price
            of $527,409 (compared to the median sales prices of $20,000), is as large as 8 standard deviational units
            above the mean. On the lower end of the spectrum (to the left of the dashed line in the middle that
            represents the mean), there is much less spread in the house prices, and those points end up bunched
            together. By eliminating some of the outliers, one may be able to see more detail for the remaining
            observations, but we will not pursue that here.</p>
          <p>Finally, we can select points in each of the quadrants (highlighted by the dashed lines) and
            identify locations in the map (or, in any other open view) associated with each of the four types of spatial
            autocorrelation.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="assessing-significance" class="section level4 unnumbered">
          <h4>Assessing significance</h4>
          <p>As such, the slope of the linear fit only provides an estimate of Moran’s I, but it does not
            reveal any information about the significance of the test statistic. This is obtained by
            means of the <strong>Randomization</strong> option.</p>
          <p>The full list of options is generated by right clicking
            (or, control clicking) on the plot, in the usual fashion. This yields the list shown in
            Figure <a href="#fig:morscatoptions">5</a>. We select <strong>Randomization</strong> and the number of
            permutations
            in the side panel. This value corresponds to the <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the expression
            for the pseudo p-value
            given above.</p>
          <p>In our example, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:morscatoptions">5</a>, we select <strong>999
              Permutations</strong>, which is typically sufficient for reliable
            inference. The most <em>extreme</em> pseudo p-value possible under this scenario is 0.001, which
            means that none of the permuted data sets yielded a statistic larger than the one observed
            in the actual data.</p>

        <div id="reference-distribution" class="section level4 unnumbered">
          <h4>Reference distribution</h4>
          <p>The result of the permutation operation is a reference distribution
            for the statistic, depicted as a histogram, as in Figure <a href="#fig:referencedist">6</a>. The green line
            shows the value of the statistic
            for the actual data, placed at 0.282 in our example, well to the right of the reference distribution. This
            suggests a strong rejection of the null hypothesis.</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:referencedist"></span>
            <img src="pics5a/2_437_permutation.png" alt="Reference distribution for Moran's I" width="60%" />
            <p class="caption">
              Figure 6: Reference distribution for Moran’s I
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>The graph contains several summary statistics. In the top left are shown the number of permutations used to
            construct the reference distribution (999) and the associated pseudo p-value. As mentioned, the latter is
            the ratio of the number of values for the statistic that are equal to or greater than the observed value (in
            our example, just 1 for the observed statistic itself) to the number of generated samples (999) + 1 (for the
            actual sample). Hence, the result is 1/(999+1) = 0.001.</p>
          <p>As pointed out earlier, this is also the smallest (most extreme) p-value that can be obtained. It is
            important to keep this in mind when comparing results where a different number of permutations is used. For
            example, a pseudo p-value of 0.001 for 999 permutations is not necessarily <em>more significant</em> than a
            pseudo p-value of 0.01 for 99 permutations. In both cases, not a single statistic computed from the randomly
            generated samples exceeded the actual statistic. This contrasts with the usual interpretation of an
            analytically derived p-value.</p>
          <p>In the status bar at the bottom of the graph appear several descriptive measures of the Moran’s I
            statistic. First is the actually observed value, I = 0.2823. Next follows the theoretical expected value,
            E[I], which equals -1/(n-1). The value of -0.0049 is indeed -1 / 204 (there are 205 observations in the data
            set). The mean is the average of the reference distribution. In our example, this result is -0.0071,
            slightly off from the theoretically expected value. The standard deviation of the reference distribution is
            0.0372, compared to a theoretical value of 0.00158 under an analytical randomization approach (not computed
            in <code>GeoDa</code>).</p>
          <p>These summary statistics illustrate a common feature in empirical work, namely that the theoretical
            indication of precision may be overly optimistic (the standard deviation is smaller in the analytical
            derivation). The z-value that corresponds to the computed Moran’s I, its empirical mean and standard
            deviation is 7.7721 (the last item to the right on the status bar). Even though a normal approximation would
            not be accurate, the z-value does suggest strong rejection of the null hypothesis.</p>
          <p>Clicking on the <strong>Run</strong> button in Figure <a href="#fig:referencedist">6</a> will generate a
            new empirical distribution. This allows for a sensitivity analysis of the results. Especially when only 99
            permutations are used, the summary statistics may vary somewhat, but for 999 (and definitely for 99999, the
            largest possible value), they should be pretty stable.</p>

        <div id="reproducibility---the-random-seed" class="section level4 unnumbered">
          <h4>Reproducibility - the random seed</h4>
          <p>In order to facilitate replication, the default setting in <code>GeoDa</code> is to use a specified
            seed for the random number generator. This is evidenced by the check mark
            next to <strong>Use Specified Seed</strong> in the options listed in Figure <a
              href="#fig:morscatoptions">5</a>.
            The default seed value used is shown when selecting the <strong>Specify Seed …</strong> box, where it also
            can be changed.</p>
          <p>The random seed can also be set globally
            in the <code>GeoDa</code> <strong>Preferences</strong>, under the <strong>System</strong> tab, as shown in
            Figure <a href="#fig:randomseedpreference">7</a>. At the bottom of the dialog, under the item
            <strong>Method:</strong>, the
            box for using the specified seed is checked by default, and the value 123456789 is used
            as the default seed. This can be changed by typing in a different value.
          </p>
          <p>The same random seed
            is used in all operations in <code>GeoDa</code> that rely on some type of random permutations (i.e., all
            flavors
            of the Moran scatter plot, and all the local spatial autocorrelation statistics). This
            ensures that the results will be identical for each analysis that uses the same
            sequence of random numbers.</p>

          <p>Using the same random seed ensures reproducibility on a particular machine. However, due to the way
            the random number generator is implemented, there may be differences depending on the hardware, specifically
            when a different number of CPU cores is used.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
              id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In order
            to control for any such discrepancies, it is possible to manually set the number of CPU cores.
            For example, in Figure <a href="#fig:randomseedpreference">7</a>, the box next to <strong>Set number of CPU
              cores manually</strong> is checked, and the number of cores is given as 8.<a href="#fn5"

          <h4>Digression - creating a Moran scatter plot as a standard scatter plot</h4>
          <p>The preferred way to construct a Moran scatter plot is to use the designated functionality
            in the <strong>Space</strong> menu. However, it is perfectly possible to create a plot <em>the hard
              way</em>,
            as a special case of a standard bivariate scatter plot. To accomplish this, we select a
            variable (standardized) for the x-axis, and its spatial lag for the y-axis.</p>
          <p>For example, in Figure <a href="#fig:morscathard">12</a>, we use the standard scatter plot
            functionality (<strong>Explore &gt; Scatter Plot</strong>) and select the just created
            <strong>MORAN_STD</strong> in the variable selection dialog for the x-axis, and its spatial
            lag <strong>MORAN_LAG</strong> as the y-axis (or, alternatively, <strong>M_ST</strong> and
            <strong>M_LAG</strong>).

            statistics are displayed below the plot (the default setting for a standard
            scatter plot). This reveals the slope of the linear fit to be <strong>0.282</strong>, the same
            as Moran’s I given by the Moran scatter plot.</p>

          <p>Apart from a purely pedagogic objective, there are some instances in practice when
            constructing a Moran scatter plot as a standard plot is the only way to obtain an
            estimate for Moran’s I (as the slope of the linear fit). One example we already encountered
            is when we use row-standardized weights derived from an inverse distance measure.
            Such weights can be employed to create a spatially lagged variable in the usual way,
            which can then serve as the y-axis in the scatter plot.</p>
          <p>The current implementation of the Moran scatter plot functionality
            in <code>GeoDa</code> ignores the specific values for the weights and only takes
            into account the presence of connectivity (i.e., non-zero weights). This is the approach
            taken for all spatial autocorrelation analyses in <code>GeoDa</code>. As a result,
            in the computation
            of the spatial lag in the Moran scatter plot, all the neighbors receive the same weight.</p>
          <p>In our discussion of inverse distance weights, we observed that it is often of interest
            <em>not</em> to row-standardize the weights. Similarly, this is the case for weights that
            include a diagonal element (kernel weights). As long as the weights are row-standardized
            and do not include a diagonal element, the slope of a standard scatter plot of the spatial
            lag against the variable will still be Moran’s I.
          </p>
          <p>However, this does not work correclty for inverse distance weights that are not row-standardized,
            or for weights that include the diagonal element. In the former case, the slope estimate is
            off by a factor <span class="math inline">\(S_0 / n\)</span>. So, in order to recuperate the value for
            Moran’s I, the slope
            estimate would have to be multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(n / S_0\)</span>. Moreover, the
            interpretation of Moran’s I
            for spatial weights that are not row-standardized may be difficult.</p>
          <p>In any case, the slope of the linear fit in a standard scatter plot is only an estimate for
            Moran’s I, but does not provide any inference. The usual standard errors and t-statistics
            provided in the scatter plot are <em>not appropriate</em> in the spatial case. An explicity
            permutation procedure would need to be carried out separately.</p>

          <h4>LOWESS smoother</h4>
          <p>In addition to the traditional linear smoother, <code>GeoDa</code> also supports a Lowess smoother for the
            Moran scatter plot (similar to the functionality in the standard scatter plot). This is accomplished by
            selecting the <strong>View &gt; LOWESS Smoother</strong> item in the options menu, illustrated in Figure <a

            Lowess smoother can be explored to identify potential structural breaks in the pattern of spatial
            autocorrelation. For example, in some parts of the data set, the curve may be very steep and positive,
            suggesting strong positive spatial autocorrelation, whereas in other parts, it could be flat, indicating no
            autocorrelation. In our example, the flatter slope of the curve for the largest values of z suggests an
            effect of the outlier (pulling the Moran’s I slope down). This can be more formally assessed by means of
            outlier and leverage statistics, but here we do not pursue this further.</p>

          as <strong>unselected</strong> (in black), currently the same as the scatter plot in the center, which
          shows the slope for all observations.</p>

          (the number of selected observations is shown in the status bar) in the
          lower right of the point map, shown in the left panel of Figure <a href="#fig:morscatselect1">18</a>. As soon

        <p>The distinguishing characteristics of this brushing operation (or, any selection) is that the spatial weights
          are <em>dynamically updated</em> for both the selection and the unselected observations.
          More precisely, for each of the subset of observations, selected and unselected, the spatial
          weights are adjusted to remove links to observations belonging to the other subset.
          In other words, there are no edge effects and each subset is treated as a self-contained
          entity.</p>
        <p>As a
          result, the slope of the Moran scatter plots on the left and the right are as if the
          data set consisted only of the selected/unselected points. This is a visual implementation of
          a <em>regionalized</em> Moran’s I, where the indicator of spatial autocorrelation is calculated
          for a subset of the observations <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-MunasingheMorris:96"
              role="doc-biblioref">Munasinghe and Morris 1996</a>)</span>.</p>
        <p>In our initial selection, the selected observations show no spatial autocorrelation at all
          (a value of 0.02),
          whereas the complement (unselected) obtain a Moran’s I of 0.280, basically the same as the overall
          statistic of 0.282.</p>
        <p>This finding would suggest the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the strength
          of the spatial autocorrelation, in the sense that the subset selected shows a very
          different degree of dependence than its complement (or the data set as a whole). Note that this is purely
          exploratory, and there is no
          actual <em>test</em> for the difference between the two statistics (this contrasts with the
          availability of the Chow test in the standard scatter plot). In our example, this would suggest
          very little spatial autocorrelation among the sales prices in the 51 selected observations,
          whereas the rest of the data shows the same pattern as the whole.</p>
        <p>As we move the <em>brush</em> to the left in the point map, the selected and unselected scatter
          plots are updated in real time, showing the corresponding regional Moran’s I statistics
          in the panels of Figure <a href="#fig:morscatselect2">19</a>.</p>

        <p>In our example, the second selection shows much less evidence of spatial heterogeneity, with

          <h4>Static and dynamic spatial weights</h4>
          <p>In the example just shown, the spatial weights were updated dynamically, to remove any edge effects.
            In contrast, in the scatter plot in Figure <a href="#fig:morscat2">13</a>, where the (standardized) sales
            price
            was plotted against its spatial lag, there is no such dynamic adjustment of the spatial weights.</p>
          <p>More precisely, this means that the spatial lag for a selected/unselected observation consists of all
            its original neighbors, including the ones that belong to the other subset.</p>
          <p>This is illustrated by the updated selection in the scatter plot, in Figure <a

            which matches the selection of 51 observations in Figure <a href="#fig:morscatselect1">18</a>. In the
            updated plot, the slope for the selected is found to be 0.170 (in red), a far cry from the 0.02 we found
            above. The slope for the unselected is 0.272, not that different from 0.280 above. The standard Chow test
            only provides
            weak evidence for spatial heterogeneity (p = 0.0517).</p>

      <h2>Spatial Correlogram</h2>
      <div id="concept-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>A non-parametric spatial correlogram is an alternative measure of global spatial autocorrelation
          that does not rely on the specification of a spatial weights matrix. Instead, a local
          regression is fit to the covariances or correlations computed for all pairs of
          observations as a function of the distance between them <span class="citation">(for example,
            as outlined in <a href="#ref-BjornstadFalck:01" role="doc-biblioref">Bjornstad and Falck 2001</a>)</span>.<a
            href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
        <p>With standardized variables <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, this boils
          down to a local regression:
          <span class="math display">\[z_i.z_j = f(d_{ij}) + u,\]</span>
          where <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij}\)</span> is the distance between a pair of locations <span
            class="math inline">\(i-j\)</span>, u is an error term, and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the
          non-parametric
          function to be determined from the data. Typically, the latter
          is a LOWESS or kernel regression.
        </p>
        <p><code>GeoDa</code> implements a spatial correlogram, i.e., the computation is based on
          standardized variables such that the cross-products correspond to correlations.
          The nonlinear curve is a LOWESS regression fit to the
          average correlation for all pairs of observations
          in a distance bin. This uses a similar logic as underlying the empirical variogram
          of geostatistics, but with a non-linear smoother applied to the bin estimates.</p>

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>The items at the top of the dialog are the <strong>Variable</strong> (available from a drop down list), the
          <strong>Distance</strong> metric (default is <strong>Euclidean</strong>, but Arc distance is also available),
          and the <strong>Number of Bins</strong>.</p>
        <p>The non-parametric correlogram is computed by means of a local regression on the pairwise correlations that
          fall within each distance bin. The number of bins determines the distance range of each bin. This range is the
          maximum distance divided by the number of bins. The more bins are chosen, the more fine-grained the
          correlogram will be. However, this also potentially can lead to too few pairs in some bins (the rule of thumb
          is to have at least 30).</p>
        <p>The number of elements in each bin is a result of the interplay between the number of bins and the maximum
          distance. As the default, all pairs are used (in our example, with 205 observations, this yields: <span
            class="math inline">\([205^2 - 205]/2 = 20910\)</span> pairs), and thus all the pairwise distances are taken
          into account. However, in many instances in practice, this may not be a good choice. For example, when there
          are many observations, the number of pairs quickly becomes unwieldy and <code>GeoDa</code> will run out of
          memory. Also, the correlations computed for pairs that are far apart are not that meaningful (they should be
          zero due to Tobler’s law). The bottom half of the dialog provides options for fine-tuning these choices.</p>
        <p>First, we consider the default, which uses all pairs and does not impose any constraints in terms of maximum
          distance. The number of bins is set to <strong>10</strong>. As before, the

          <h4>Interpretation</h4>
          <p>At the top of the graph in Figure <a href="#fig:correlogram1price">24</a> is the actual correlogram,
            depicting how the spatial autocorrelation changes with distance. Hovering the pointer over each blue dot,
            gives the spatial autocorrelation associated with that distance band in the status bar. In our example, the
            first dot corresponds to 0.202048 for distances between 0 and 4823 feet (or about 0.9 miles).</p>
          <p>The intersection between the correlogram and the dashed zero axis (which determines the range of spatial
            autocorrelation) happens in the midpoint of the second range (4823 to 9647 feet), i.e., 7235, or roughly
            around 1.4 miles. Beyond that range, the autocorrelation is first negative and then fluctuates around the
            zero line.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of the graph is a histogram that shows the number of pairs of observations in each bin.
            Hovering the pointer over a given bin shows how many pairs
            are contained in the bin in the status bar. In our example, each bin clearly has more than sufficient
            observation pairs. Even the last bin, which seems small (a function of the vertical scale), uses 75 pairs
            for the computation.</p>
          <p>Further detail is provided when selecting the <strong>Display Statistics</strong> option (right click
            on the graph). As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:correlogram1wstats">25</a>, for each bin, the computed
            autocorrelation is provided, as well as the distance range for the bin (lower and upper bound), and the
            number of pairs used to compute the statistic.</p>
          <p>In addition, there is a summary with the minimum and maximum distance, the total number of pairs, and an
            estimate
            for the range (i.e., the distance at which the estimated autocorrelation first becomes zero).
            In our example, the latter is estimated to be about 7,225 feet (about 1.4 miles). Right
            after the listing of the value for the range, the lower and upper bound of the bin where the
            correlogram crosses the axis is given (this provides an alternative, but less precise approximation of the
            range).</p>

        <h3>Spatial correlogram options</h3>
        <p>In <code>GeoDa</code>, there are two sets of spatial correlogram options. One consists of the
          <strong>parameters</strong>
          of the model, as specified in the dialog shown in Figure <a href="#fig:correlogram1vars">23</a>. The other
          set of options are invoked in the usual way, by right clicking on the graph. We already referred
          to the <strong>Display Statistics</strong> option above. The full list of options is shown in Figure <a
            href="#fig:correlogramoptions">26</a>.</p>

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>One interesting option is to <strong>Save Results</strong>. This provides a record of the descriptive
          statistics of the correlogram in a text file (with file extension csv). The file contains
          the information listed at the bottom of the graph when <strong>Display Statistics</strong> has been selected.
          This includes the estimates of the spatial autocorrelation, bin ranges, number of observations in
          the bins and the summary items.</p>
        <div id="lowess-parameters" class="section level4 unnumbered">
          <h4>LOWESS parameters</h4>
          <p>The selection highlighted in Figure <a href="#fig:correlogramoptions">26</a> pertains to the
            <strong>LOWESS Parameters</strong>, i.e., the bandwidth and other technical options that can be
            specified for any LOWESS smoother. The default is to use a bandwidth of 0.20, which works
            well in most situations. As usual, a larger bandwidth will yield a (slightly) smoother curve,
            and a smaller bandwidth the opposite. This works in exactly the same way as for the standard
            LOWESS nonlinear smoother.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="distance-settings" class="section level4 unnumbered">
          <h4>Distance settings</h4>
          <p>In most situations, the default use of all the distance pairs is too overwhelming. Also,
            there is a good reason to limit the maximum distance, since correlations at large(r) distances
            are both sparser (fewer pairs in a bin, which leads to less precise estimates) and supposed
            to be near zero (Tobler’s law).</p>
          <p>There are several rules of thumb to set the maximum distance. <code>GeoDa</code> uses half of the
            maximum distance as a point of departure. By checking the box next to <strong>Max Distance</strong> and
            clicking on the button in the middle of the slider bar, half the maximum distance
            (<strong>24131.4</strong>) is listed in the box, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:distancebox">27</a>. This
            reduces the number of pairs used to compute
            the correlations almost by half, from 20910 to roughly 10557.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"

          <p>The corresponding correlogram in Figure <a href="#fig:correlogram2">28</a> emphasizes the autocorrelation
            pattern over the shorter distance ranges. It suggests a range for the correlation that is basically the same
            as the
            initial result, about 7,244 feet (compared to 7,225). The status bar lists the autocorrelation given by the
            point over which the pointer hovers (in our example, about -0.056 for the
            fourth bin).</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:correlogram2"></span>

              Figure 28: Correlogram with half max distance
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>In order to get an even more precise measure of the range, we can specify the maximum distance as 20000
            feet (3.8 miles) by typing this value into the bin, and select 20 bins (there are plenty of observations, so
            there is no danger of having fewer than 30 pairs in any bin).</p>
          <p>The resulting correlogram, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:correlogram3">29</a>, has a distance range for
            each bin of 1000 feet (about 0.2 miles). This provides a much finer grained measure of the range of spatial
            autocorrelation (this may require some expansion of the window to clearly see all the values on the
            horizontal axis and the displayed statistics).</p>
          <p>The intersection between the correlogram and the zero axis is almost exactly in the middle of the 6000-7000
            foot range, about 6775 feet (or 1.3 miles). In sum, by changing the correlogram parameters from the default
            to a much smaller value and increasing the number
            of bins, the estimate of our range of spatial interaction goes from about 7200 feet to about 6800 feet. This
            highlights the importance of sensitivity analysis and going beyond the default values.</p>

          <h4>Large(r) data issues – random sampling</h4>
          <p>A final feature of the correlogram in <code>GeoDa</code> is the ability to compute the spatial correlations
            for a sample of locations, which reduces the number of pairs used in the calculations. This is especially
            useful when the data set is large, in which case the number of pairs could quickly become prohibitive.</p>
          <p>In our example, this is not really necessary, since the default sample size of 1,000,000 that is used to
            generate the random sample exceeds the current total number of pairs in the actual data. Nevertheless, to
            illustrate the process, we go back and use <strong>20000</strong> for the maximum distance, with 10 bins,
            and check the <strong>Random Sample</strong> radio button, with <strong>10000</strong> for the sample size,
            as in
            Figure <a href="#fig:correlogramrandomoption">30</a>. To allow exact replication, we make sure that the
            <strong>Use specified seed</strong> option is checked.

            higher, at 0.513, but the range is again roughly 7000 feet. In general, the sampling approximation is quite

      <h2>Smoothed Distance Scatter Plot</h2>
      <div id="concept-2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>The smoothed distance scatter plot, outlined in <span class="citation">Anselin and Li (<a
              href="#ref-AnselinLi:20" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, provides yet another way
          to visualize global spatial autocorrelation. Instead of using a correlation measure, this approach
          employs the distance in (multi-)attribute space as a measure of dissimilarity. This is analogous in
          spirit to the approach taken for Geary’s c statistic. However, rather than using squared differences, the
          actual distance is employed,
          i.e., the square root of the squared distances. This also contrasts with the semi-variogram, where an estimate
          of the squared difference is used as well.</p>
        <p>For a single variable, the attribute distance between observations for z at i and j is:
          <span class="math display">\[v_{ij} = \sqrt{(z_i - z_j)^2}.\]</span>
          In contrast to the correlation measures considered so far, this concept of distance in attribute space
          can readily be extended to multiple variables:
          <span class="math display">\[v_{ij} = \sqrt{\sum_{h=1}^k (z_{ih} - z_{jh})^2},\]</span>
          where <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is an index for the variable under consideration, going from 1 to
          <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.
        </p>
        <p>The idea of the distance scatter plot is to use the attribute distance measure on the vertical axis, with the
          usual Euclidean distance between observations on the horizontal axis:
          <span class="math display">\[d_{ij} = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2},\]</span>
          with <span class="math inline">\(x, y\)</span> as the observation’s locational coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>For any but the smallest data sets, the resulting scatter plot will have too many points
          (for all pairs) to be very insightful. Therefore, smoothing the scatter plot is critical.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the approach taken in the correlogram, a local regression smoother
          is applied to the full scatter plot, and not to averages computed for distance bins.
          The resulting graph should increase with distance (Tobler’s law) up to a point where the
          <em>range</em> of interaction is reached. Beyond this distance, there is typically little relation
          between increases in Euclidean distance and increase in dissimilarity, suggesting a lack
          of spatial correlation.
        </p>
        <p>A slightly different pattern occurs when similar subregions are
          distributed over space, in which case the curve can show alternating positive and negative
          slopes. The negative slope does not necessarily violate Tobler’s law, but suggests the
          presence of negative spatial autocorrelation at a larger scale, where similar subregions are spread out in
          space, separated
          by dissimilar areas. As a result, once the distance separating observations is large enough to
          reach the next similar subregion, the dissimilarity goes down.</p>
        <p>Our main interest in this graph is to obtain an estimate of the range of interaction, i.e.,
          the point where the curve begins to flatten out (or turns negative).</p>

        <h3>Creating a smoothed distance scatter plot</h3>
        <p>The smoothed distance plot is invoked as the second option from the spatial correlogram icon shown
          in Figure <a href="#fig:correlogramicon">21</a>, or as <strong>Space &gt; Distance Scatter Plot</strong> from
          the menu.
          The following dialog allows for the selection of the variable(s) and the parameters for the analysis.
          In our illustration, we only select <strong>sale_price</strong>, since the sample data set does not contain
          any
          other meaningful variables. However, the extension to multiple variables is straightforward. The
          corresponding distance measure is the distance in multi-attribute space.</p>

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>The main parameters are the choice of distance metric, i.e., <strong>Euclidean</strong> (the default) or
          <strong>Manhattan</strong> distance for
          either the attributes (variables) and geographic distance.</p>
        <p>The other selections are the same as for the correlogram. The default distance range is 1/2 of the maximum
          distance,
          with the other built-in option as 1/2 the diameter of the bounding box. As before, this distance can be set
          manually
          as well. Finally, there is a choice between considering all observation pairs within the given distance range,
          or to use the same random sampling technique as for the spatial correlogram.</p>
        <p>With all the options set to their default values, clicking on <strong>Apply</strong> yields the plot shown in
          Figure <a href="#fig:distplot">33</a>.</p>

        <p>We will adjust the plot using the options to bring out the overall pattern more clearly, but
          in general the plot increases until a distance of about mid-way between 10,000 and 15,000 feet, after which
          it flattens out and even decreases.</p>

            up the options, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:distoptions">34</a>. Most of these are the same as for the
            spatial correlogram,

        <div id="smoothing-options" class="section level4 unnumbered">
          <h4>Smoothing options</h4>
          <p>The smoothing of the distance scatter plot is based on the local polynomial regression fitting by means of
            the LOESS algorithm.
            This operates in a slightly different way from the LOWESS approach, but is equally based on a moving fit
            over a subset
            of the observations, with observations that are further from the reference point downweighted.</p>
          <p>The parameters of the LOESS smooth are set as one of the options. The details are shown in
            Figure <a href="#fig:loessoptions">37</a>. As before, the most important parameter is the bandwidth,
            referred to as the <strong>span</strong>
            in the LOESS context. The default value of 0.75 is usually appropriate (a smaller value yields a spikier
            smooth, a larger value a more linear one). Other choices are the degree for the polynomial, typically
            parabolic (2). The estimation method is set in the <strong>Family</strong> parameter, with the default as
            <strong>gaussian</strong> (i.e., least squares fit). An alternative option is a
            more robust M estimator (<strong>symmetric</strong>).</p>
          <p>The default settings are appropriate in most circumstances.</p>
