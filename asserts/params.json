{"name":"GeoDa","tagline":"GeoDa (TM): Software providing an introduction to spatial data analysis.","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nGeoDa TM is built upon several open source libraries and source-code files.\r\n\r\nGeoDa is the flagship program of the GeoDa Center, following a long line of software tools developed by Dr. Luc Anselin. It is designed to implement techniques for exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) on lattice data (points and polygons). The free program provides a user friendly and graphical interface to methods of descriptive spatial data analysis, such as spatial autocorrelation statistics, as well as basic spatial regression functionality. The latest version contains several new features such as full space-time data support in all views, a new cartogram, a refined map movie, parallel coordinate plot, 3D visualization, conditional plots (and maps) and spatial regression.\r\n\r\nSince its initial release in February 2003, GeoDa's user numbers have increased exponentially, as the chart and map of global users above shows. This includes lab users at universities such as Harvard, MIT, and Cornell. The user community and press embraced the program enthusiastically, calling it a \"hugely important analytic tool,\" a \"very fine piece of software,\" an \"exciting development\" and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependencies \r\n\r\nBelow is a list of some of these that we'd like to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nBoost Libraries, version 1.53\r\nLicense: Boost Software License - Version 1.0\r\nAuthors: many\r\nLinks: http://www.boost.org/\r\n       http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt\r\n\r\nBoost.Polygon Voronoi Library, Boost version 1.53\r\nLicense: Boost Software License - Version 1.0\r\nAuthor: Andrii Sydorchuk\r\nLinks: http://www.boost.org/\r\n       http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt\r\n\r\nwxWidgets Cross-Platform GUI Library, version 2.9.4\r\nLicense: The wxWindows Library Licence\r\nAuthors: Julian Smart, Robert Roebling, and others\r\nLinks: http://www.wxwidgets.org/\r\n       http://www.opensource.org/licenses/wxwindows.php\r\n\r\nCLAPACK Linear Algebra Libraries, version 3.2.1\r\nAuthors: many\r\nLicense: Custom by University of Tennessee\r\nLinks: http://www.netlib.org/clapack/\r\n       http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-3.2/LICENSE\r\n\r\nApproximate Nearest Neighbor Library, version 0.1\r\nNote: Full source of 0.1 release included in kNN directory\r\nAuthors: Sunil Arya and David Mount\r\nLicense: See kNN/AHH.h in included source files\r\nLinks: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/\r\n\r\nFastArea.c++ source code\r\nNote: We have based the source for functions findArea and\r\n      ComputeArea2D in our file GenGeomAlgs.h from FastArea.c++\r\n      in Journal of Graphics Tools, 7(2):9-13, 2002\r\nAuthor: Daniel Sunday\r\nLicense: unknown\r\nLinks: http://jgt.akpeters.com/papers/Sunday02/FastArea.html\r\n\r\nlogger.h source code\r\nAuthor: Seweryn Habdank-Wojewodzki\r\nNote: We have copied the source for logger.h and modified it slightly\r\n      to work with wxString.\r\nLicense: Boost Software License - Version 1.0\r\nLinks: http://accu.org/index.php/journals/1304\r\n\r\nnullstream.h source code\r\nAuthor: Maciej Sobczak\r\nLicense: See logger.h in included source files\r\nLinks: http://www.msobczak.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
