<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this Chapter, we consider two situations where the values for the spatial weights take
on a special meaning. The weights are transformations of the original distances. The
two examples covered consist of inverse
distance functions and kernel weights.</p>
<p>The resulting weights files primarily provide the basis for creating new spatially explicit variables
for use in further analyses, such as in spatial regression specifications.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The weights themselves
are <em>not</em> used in measures of spatial autocorrelation or other exploratory analyses in GeoDa,
where only the existence of a neighbor relation is taken into account.</p>
<p>We will illustrate this functionality with the data set that we used earlier for point locations of house sales for Cleveland, OH.</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>We will again use the data set that contains the location and sales price of 205 homes in a core area of Cleveland, OH for the fourth quarter of 2015.
We get started by clearing the previous project and dropping the file <strong>clev_sls_154_core.shp</strong> into the <strong>Drop files here</strong> rectangle of the connect to data source dialog. Alternatively, we can use
a project file if we saved one earilier (e.g., <strong>clev_sls_154_core.gda</strong>). The familiar themeless base map results, as
in Figure <a href="#fig:homeclev">1</a>.</p>

<div id="inverse-distance-weights" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Inverse Distance Weights</h2>
<div id="concepts" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Concepts</h3>
<p>One can readily view spatial weights
based on a distance cut-off as representing a step function,
with a value of 1 for neighbors with <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij} &lt; \delta\)</span>, and a value of
0 for others. As before, <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij}\)</span> stands for the distance between observations
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the bandwidth.</p>
<p>A straightforward extension of this principle is to consider a
continuous parameterized
function of distance itself:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
w_{ij} = f(d_{ij},\mathbf{\theta}),
\end{equation}\]</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as a functional form and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\theta}\)</span> a
vector of parameters.</p>
<p>In order to conform to Tobler’s first law of geography,
a distance <em>decay</em> effect must be respected.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In other words, the value of the function of distance
needs to <em>decrease</em> with a growing distance. More formally, the partial derivative
of the distance function with respect to distance should be negative,
<span class="math inline">\(\partial w_{ij} / \partial d_{ij} &lt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Commonly used distance functions are the inverse, with <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij} = 1 / d_{ij}^{\alpha}\)</span>
(and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> as a parameter),
and the negative exponential, with <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij} = e^{-\beta d_{ij}}\)</span>
(and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> as a parameter).
The functions are often combined
with a distance cut-off criterion, such that <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij} = 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij} &gt; \delta\)</span>.</p>
<p>In practice, the parameters are seldom estimated, but typically set
to a fixed value, such as <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 1\)</span> for inverse distance weights (<span class="math inline">\(1/d_{ij}\)</span>), and
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 2\)</span> for gravity weights (<span class="math inline">\(1/d_{ij}^{2}\)</span>).
By convention, the diagonal elements
of the spatial weights are set to zero and not computed. Plugging
in a value of <span class="math inline">\(d_{ii} = 0\)</span> would
yield division by zero for inverse distance weights.</p>
<p>The distance-based weights depend not only on the parameter value and
functional form, but also on the metric used for distance. Since the
weights are inversely related to distance, large values for the latter
will yield small values for the former, and vice versa. This may be a
problem in practice when the distances are so large (i.e., measured
in small units) that the corresponding
inverse
distance weights become close to zero, possibly resulting in a zero
spatial weights matrix.</p>
<p>In addition, a potential
problem may occur when the distance metric is such that distances take
on values less than one. As a consequence, some inverse distance values
may be larger than one, which is typically not a desired result.</p>
<p>Rescaling
of the coordinates will fix both problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-inverse-distance-functions-for-distance-bands" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Creating inverse distance functions for distance bands</h3>
<p>We proceed in the usual fashion to create spatial weights based on an inverse
distance function. In the <strong>Weights File Creation</strong> interface, we specify
<strong>unique_id</strong> as the ID variable, and select the <strong>Distance Weight</strong> option.</p>
<p>As before, we choose <strong>Distance band</strong> from the three types of weights. The
default bandwidth of 3598.055030 is the same as encountered previously. We
keep it as is for now. The
<strong>inverse distance</strong> option is invoked by the check box below the bandwidth
entry, as in Figure <a href="#fig:invdistoption">2</a>. For now, we keep the <strong>Power</strong>
value to its default of 1.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:invdistoption"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2: Inverse distance option
</p>
</div>
<p>Clicking on the <strong>Create</strong> button results in the usual query for a file name specification. The inverse distance
weights are saved in a file with a <strong>GWT</strong> extension, say <strong>clev_sls_154_core_id1.gwt</strong>.</p>
<div id="properties-of-inverse-distance-weights" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Properties of inverse distance weights</h4>
<p>As soon as the file is created, the properties of the weights appear in the weights manager,
as illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:invdistprop">3</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:invdistprop"></span>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Since the properties only pertain to the connectivity structure implied by the weights, they
are identical to the ones obtained for the standard distance-band weights. It is important to
keep in mind that the actual values for the weights are <em>ignored</em> in this operation. The
only differences between the two property lists are the listing of <strong>inverse distance</strong> as <strong>true</strong>,
and the value for <strong>power</strong> as <strong>1</strong>.</p>
<p>The connectivity map and the connectivity graph associated with the weights are the same
as before as well.
For example, the connectivity graph shown in Figure <a href="#fig:invdistconn">4</a> is identical
to the one we obtained for the distance-band weights.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The default bandwidth is such that each location is ensured to have at least one neighbor, but
as we have seen before, this can be changed. This allows inverse distance weights to be calculated
for any bandwidth specified. For example, if the bandwidth is set as the maximum inter-point distance,
the resulting weights will be for a <em>full</em> matrix. This is not recommended for larger data sets, but
it can provide a useful point of departure to compute various accessibility indices.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="inverse-distance-weights-in-the-gwt-file" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Inverse distance weights in the GWT file</h4>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:invdistgwt">5</a> provides a comparison of the entries in the GWT file for respectively
the distance-band weights and the inverse distance weights. We notice that the pairs of neighbors
are identical, as expected. Also, the value for the inverse distance weight is exactly the inverse
of the distance.</p>

</div>
<div id="using-non-geographical-coordinates" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Using non-geographical coordinates</h4>
<p>So far, we have been using the default setting of <strong>&lt;X-Centroids&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;Y-Centroids&gt;</strong> for
the coordinates that were the input into the distance calculations. However, this option is
perfectly general, and any two variables contained in the data set can be specified as x, y coordinates.
For example, this allows for the computation of so-called <em>socio-economic</em> weights, where the
difference between two locations on any two variables can be used as the distance metric.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>We illustrate this feature in Figure <a href="#fig:invdistxy">6</a>, where we explicitly specify the x and
y coordinates as the variables <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> (the sample data set does not include any other
meaningful variables besides the house price). Also, we compute inverse distance squared by
setting the <strong>Power</strong> parameter to <strong>2</strong>.</p>

</div>
<p>The contents of the resulting GWT file are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:invdist2gwt">7</a>. This highlights
the problem alluded to above, i.e., that the value of the weights critically depends on the distance
metric. In our example, the second power of the inverse distances result in weights that are
essentially not distinguishable from zero.</p>

</div>
<p>Note that since the connectivity properties ignore the actual weights, they will again not differ
from the ones obtained for the matching distance-band weights. However, any calculation of spatially
explicit variables using these weights (e.g., a spatially lagged variable) would be largely
meaningless, since the spatially lagged variables would all roughly equal zero. The importance of
this potential problem
cannot be stressed enough, since a <em>mechanical</em> computation using these weights could lead
to very misleading results in further analyses.</p>

</div>
<div id="creating-inverse-distance-functions-for-k-nearest-neighbors" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Creating inverse distance functions for k-nearest neighbors</h3>
<p>Computing inverse distance weights is not limited to a distance band specification. As shown
in Figure <a href="#fig:knnid1">8</a>, the <strong>inverse distance</strong> option is also available for
<strong>K-Nearest neighbors</strong>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:knnid1"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 8: Inverse distance for k-nearest neighbors
</p>
</div>
<p>This option works in the same way as for the distance bands. With the
<strong>Number of neighbors</strong> and a <strong>Power</strong> specified, the
new weights are computed from the distances between the k nearest neighbors for each location. In
Figure <a href="#fig:knnid1gwt">9</a>, the original k-nearest distances (with k=6, as specified
in Figure <a href="#fig:knnid1">8</a>) and the corresponding inverse weights entries are shown from the
respective GWT files.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>As is the case for the inverse distance band weights, the actual values of the inverse knn weights
are ignored in further spatial analyses in GeoDa. They can only be used in the calculation of
spatially explicit variables.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="kernel-weights" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Kernel Weights</h2>
<div id="concepts-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Concepts</h3>
<p>Kernel weights are used in non-parametric approaches to model
spatial covariance, such as in the HAC method for heteroskedastic
and spatial autocorrelation consistent variance estimates.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In GeoDa, kernel functions can be computed, but as is the case for the other distance functions,
the actual values of the weights are only used in the computation of spatially explicit variables.</p>
<p>The kernel weights are defined as a function <span class="math inline">\(K(z)\)</span> of the ratio between the
distance <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij}\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, and the bandwidth <span class="math inline">\(h_i\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(z = d_{ij} / h_i\)</span>. This ensures
that <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is always less than 1. For distances greater than the bandwidth, <span class="math inline">\(K(z) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Five different kernel weights functions are currently supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniform, <span class="math inline">\(K(z) = 1/2\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(|z| &lt; 1\)</span>,</li>
<li>Triangular, <span class="math inline">\(K(z) = (1 - |z| )\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(|z| &lt; 1\)</span>,</li>
<li>Quadratic or Epanechnikov, <span class="math inline">\(K(z) = (3/4) (1 - z^2)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(|z| &lt; 1\)</span>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
<li>Quartic, <span class="math inline">\(K(z) = (15/16)(1 - z^2)^2\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(|z| &lt; 1\)</span>, and</li>
<li>Gaussian. <span class="math inline">\(K(z) = (2 \pi)^{(1/2)} \exp(- z^2 / 2)\)</span>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Typically, the value for the diagonal elements of the
weights is set to 1, although GeoDa allows for the actual kernel value to be
used as well.</p>
<p>Many careful decisions must be made in selecting a kernel
weights function. Apart from the choice of a functional form for
<span class="math inline">\(K(\ )\)</span>, a crucial aspect is the selection of the bandwidth. In the
literature, the latter is found to be more important than the functional
form.</p>
<p>A drawback of fixed bandwidth kernel weights is that the number
of non-zero weights can vary considerably, especially when the
density of the point locations is not uniform throughout space.
This is the same problem encountered for the distance band spatial
weights.</p>
<p>In GeoDa, there are two types of fixed bandwidths for
kernel weights. One is the max-min distance used earlier (the largest
of the nearest-neighbor distances). The other is the maximum distance
for a given specification of k-nearest neighbors. For example, with knn
set to a given value, this is the distance between the selected k-nearest
neighbors pairs that are the farthest apart.</p>
<p>To correct for the issues associated with a fixed bandwidth, a <em>variable bandwidth</em> approach
adjusts the bandwidth for each location to ensure equal or near-equal
coverage. One common approach is to take the k-nearest neighbors,
and to adjust the bandwidth for each location such that exactly k neighbors
are included in the kernel function. The bandwidth specific to each location
is then any distance
larger than its k nearest neighbor distance, but less than the k+1
nearest neighbor distance.</p>
<p>In GeoDa, the default value for k equals the cube root of the number
of observations <span class="citation">(following the recommendation in Kelejian and Prucha <a href="#ref-KelejianPrucha:07">2007</a>)</span>. In general,
a wider bandwidth gives smoother and more robust results, so the bandwidth
should always be set at least as large as the recommended default.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-kernel-weights" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Creating kernel weights</h3>
<p>We create kernel weights in the by now familiar fashion, by selecting the
<strong>Adaptive kernel</strong> option under the <strong>Distance Weight</strong> button of the
<strong>Weights File Creation</strong> dialog. Figure <a href="#fig:kerneloption">10</a> illustrates the
five kernel functions that are available.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:kerneloption"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 10: Kernel weight options
</p>
</div>
<p>To illustrate this functionality, we select the <strong>Triangular</strong> option, with the
<strong>Adaptive bandwidth</strong> set to the default number of neighbors of 6. We also leave
the <strong>Diagonal weights</strong> option to its default of 1 (i.e., the kernel function is not applied
to a distance of zero for the diagonal elements). These settings are illustrated in
Figure <a href="#fig:triangular">11</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:triangular"></span>
<img src="pics4c/2_852_tri_adaptive.png" alt="Triangular adaptive kernel" width="60%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 11: Triangular adaptive kernel
</p>
</div>
<p>The results are saved in a file with file extension <strong>KWT</strong>
(such as <strong>clev_sls_154_core_tri6.kwt</strong>). The KWT file extension is adopted to retain
compatibility with the conventions assumed for PySAL and its spreg module, as implemented
in GeoDaSpace. Except for the inclusion of the diagonal element, its structure is the same
as a GWT format file.</p>
<p>The contents of the KWT file in our example are shown in the right-hand panel of
Figure <a href="#fig:trianglekwt">12</a>, compared to the knn distances in the corresponding GWT file on the left.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>A few characteristics of the results should be noted. First, the bandwidth is determined by the
largest distance among the six neighbors. In the current example, for the first observation considered (with unique_id 1183), this is the
distance given on the first row.
The distance between 1183 and 6842 amounts to
3253.02459, as shown in the left panel of Figure <a href="#fig:trianglekwt">12</a>. By convention, each other distance is
converted to a value less than one by dividing it by this maximum distance.</p>
<p>For example, for the second pair
(between 1183 and 2024), this would yield 1858.90398/3253.02459 = 0.571439 (the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-value referred
to above). The result for the triangular kernel is then 1 - 0.571439 = 0.428561, i.e., the value
shown on the second line of the KWT file.</p>
<p>For the pair with the largest distance, the value of the kernel is zero (1 - 1). Finally, for the
diagonal element (the pair 1183, 1183), the kernel is given as 1, by construction.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<div id="properties-of-kernel-weights" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Properties of kernel weights</h4>
<p>As soon as the weights are created, their properties appear in the weights manager.
As illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:triangleprop">13</a>, the descriptive statistics are again the
same as for standard knn weights. The differences are in the first six items. The <strong>type</strong> of
weights is given as kernel, the <strong>kernel method</strong> is identified (triangular), with the bandwidth
definition (<strong>knn 6</strong>) and <strong>adptive kernel</strong> set to true. It is also indicated that
the kernel is not applied to the diagonal elements (<strong>kernel to diagonal</strong> is false).
Also, as for the knn weights, the resulting weights are asymmetric. These items will
be saved to a project file when one is created.</p>

<p>Since the connectivity histogram, map and graph ignore the actual weights values and are
solely based on the implied connectivity structure, they are identical to those obtained
for the corresponding knn weights. For example,
Figure <a href="#fig:triangleconn">14</a> showns the connectivity graph, which is the same as generated
in the previous Chapter.</p>

<div id="treatment-of-diagonal-elements" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Treatment of diagonal elements</h4>
<p>As mentioned, for a triangular kernel, the diagonal elements equal one, irrespective of the
setting for that option. To illustrate the effect of applying the kernel function to the diagonal
elements, we choose the <strong>Epanechnikov</strong> option, as shown
Figure <a href="#fig:epadiag">15</a>. The <strong>Apply kernel to diagonal weights</strong> radio button is selected as well.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>All other options are the same as before. The contents of the resulting KWT file, again compared
to the knn GWT file, are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:epakwt">16</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:epakwt"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>As before, the value for the most separated points is zero, but now the diagonal elements equal
0.75, which results from the 3/4 scaling factor being applied to 1. In all other respects, these
weights are treated in the same way as the others discussed in this Chapter.</p>
