      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In this Chapter, we will begin our exploration of the analysis of local spatial autocorrelation statistics,
        focusing
        on the concept and its most common implementation in the form of the Local Moran statistic. We will explore how
        it can be utilized to discover hot spots and cold spots in the data, as well
        as spatial outliers. To illustrate these techniques, we will use the Guerry data set on
        moral statistics in 1830 France, which comes pre-installed with <code>GeoDa</code>.</p>

        <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
        <p>We again use a data set that is comes built-in with <code>GeoDa</code> and is also
          contained in the <a href="https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/">GeoDa Center data set collection</a>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/Guerry/">Guerry</a>: moral statistics of France in
            1830</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br>
          You can either load this data from the <strong>Sample Data</strong> tab, or, if you downloaded the files, drop
          the <strong>guerry_85</strong> shape file into the usual
          <strong>Drop files here</strong> box in the dialog.
          This brings up the familiar themeless base map, showing the 85 French departments.
        </p>
        <p>To carry out the spatial autocorrelation analysis, we will need a spatial weights file, either created from
          scratch, or loaded from a previous analysis (ideally, contained in a project file).
          The <strong>Weights Manager</strong> should have at least one spatial weights file included, e.g.,
          <strong>guerry_85_q</strong> for first order queen contiguity.
        </p>
        <p>For this univariate analysis, we will focus on the variable <strong>Donatns</strong> (charitable donations
          per capita). This variable displays an interesting spatial distribution, as illustrated in a natural breaks
          map (using 6 categories), in Figure <a href="#fig:donatnatbreak">1</a>. The global Moran’s I is 0.353, using
          queen contiguity, and highly
          significant at p&lt;0.001 (not shown here).</p>

    <div id="lisa-principle" class="section level2 unnumbered" number="">
      <h2>LISA Principle</h2>
      <p>As we have seen in the discussion of global spatial autocorrelation, such statistics (e.g., Moran’s I, Geary’s
        c)
        are designed to reject the null hypothesis of spatial randomness in favor of an alternative of
        <em>clustering</em>.
        Such <em>clustering</em> is a characteristic of the complete spatial pattern and does <em>not</em> provide an
        indication
        of the <em>location</em> of the clusters.</p>
      <p>The concept of a local indicator of spatial association, or <em>LISA</em> was suggested in <span
          class="citation">Anselin (<a href="#ref-Anselin:95" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span> to remedie
        this situation. A LISA is seen as having two important characteristics. First, it provides a statistic for
        each location with an assessment of significance. Second, it establishes a proportional relationship between
        the sum of the local statistics and a corresponding global statistic.</p>
      <p>Most global spatial autocorrelation statistics can be expressed as
        a double sum over the i and j indices, such as <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i \sum_j g_{ij}\)</span>. The
        local form of such a statistic would then be, for each observation (location) <span
          class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, the sum
        of the relevant expression over the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> index, <span
          class="math inline">\(\sum_j g_{ij}\)</span>.</p>
      <p>More precisely, we have seen that
        a spatial autocorrelation statistic consists of a combination of a measure of attribute similarity between
        a pair of observations, <span class="math inline">\(f(x_i,x_j)\)</span>, with an indicator for geographical or
        locational similarity, in the form of
        spatial weights, <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij}\)</span>. For a global statistic, this takes on the form
        <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i \sum_j w_{ij}f(x_i,x_j)\)</span>. A generic
        form for a local indicator of spatial association is then:
        <span class="math display">\[\sum_j w_{ij}f(x_i,x_j).\]</span>
        As there are many statistics for global spatial autocorrelation, there will be many corresponding LISA. In this
        Chapter, we focus on the local counterpart of Moran’s I.
      </p>

    <div id="local-moran" class="section level2 unnumbered" number="">
      <h2>Local Moran</h2>
      <div id="principle" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Principle</h3>
        <p>The Local Moran statistic was suggested in <span class="citation">Anselin (<a href="#ref-Anselin:95"
              role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span> as a way to identify local
          clusters and local spatial outliers.</p>
        <p>With row-standardized weights, the sum of all weights, <span class="math inline">\(S_0 = \sum_i \sum_j
            w_{ij}\)</span> equals the number of
          observations, n. As a result, as we have seen in the discussion of the Moran scatter plot, the Moran’s I
          statistic simplifies to:
          <span class="math display">\[I = \frac{\sum_i \sum_j w_{ij} z_iz_j}{\sum_i z_i^2},\]</span>
          with the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> in deviations from the mean (or fully standardized, such that
          the variance equals one).
        </p>
        <p>Using the logic just outlined, a corresponding <em>Local</em> Moran statistic would consist of the component
          in the double sum that corresponds to each observation <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, or:
          <span class="math display">\[I_i = \frac{\sum_j w_{ij} z_iz_j}{\sum_i z_i^2}.\]</span>
          In this expression, the denominator is fixed and can thus further be ignored. For notational
          simplicity, we replace it by <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, so that the Local Moran expression
          becomes <span class="math inline">\(c.\sum_j w_{ij} z_iz_j\)</span>.
          After some re-arranging, we obtain the expression:
          <span class="math display">\[I_i = c. z_i \sum_j w_{ij} z_j,\]</span>
          or, the product of the value at location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with its spatial lag, the
          weighted sum of the values at
          neighboring locations. A little bit of algebra shows that the sum of the local statistics is proporational
          to the global Moran’s I, or, alternatively, that the global Moran’s I corresponds with the average
          of the local statistics <span class="citation">(for details, see Anselin <a href="#ref-Anselin:95"
              role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Significance can be based on an analytical approximation, but, as argued in <span class="citation">Anselin
            (<a href="#ref-Anselin:95" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>, this is not
          very reliable in practice. A preferred approach consists of
          a <em>conditional</em> permutation method. This is similar to the permutation approach considered in the
          Moran scatter plot, except that the value of each <span class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span> is held fixed at
          its location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The remaining n-1
          z-values are then randomly permuted to yield a <em>reference distribution</em> for the local statistic (one
          for
          each location).</p>
        <p>This
          operates in the same fashion as for the global Moran’s I, except that the permutation is carried out for each
          observation in turn. The result is a pseudo p-value for each location, which can then be used to assess
          significance. Note that this notion of significance is not the standard one, and should not be interpreted
          that way
          (see also the discussion of multiple comparisons below).</p>
        <p>Assessing significance in and of itself is not that useful for the Local Moran. However, when an indication
          of significance is combined with the location of each observation in the Moran Scatterplot, a very powerful
          interpretation becomes
          possible. The combined information allows for a classification of the
          significant locations as High-High and Low-Low <em>spatial clusters</em>, and High-Low and
          Low-High <em>spatial outliers</em>. It is important to keep in mind that the reference to high and low is
          <em>relative</em> to the
          mean of the variable, and should not be interpreted in an absolute sense.</p>

          <p>The significance map shows the locations with a significant local statistic, with the
            degree of significance reflected in increasingly darker shades of green. The map starts with
            p &lt; 0.05 and shows all the categories of significance that are meaningful for the given
            number of permutations. In our example, since there were 999 permutations, the smallest
            pseudo p-value is 0.001, with four such locations (the darkest shade of green).</p>
          <p>The cluster map augments the significant locations with an indication of the type of spatial
            association, based on the location of the value and its spatial lag in the Moran scatter
            plot (see also the discussion below). In this example, all four categories are represented,
            with dark red for the high-high clusters (eight in our example), dark blue for the
            low-low clusters (seventeen locations), light blue for the low-high spatial outliers
            (two locations), and light red for the high-low spatial outliers (two locations).</p>

          <p>The <strong>Randomization</strong> option is the first item in the options menu for both the
            significance map and the cluster map. It operates in the same fashion as for the
            Moran scatter plot. As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:localrandomizationoption">7</a>, up to 99999
            permutations are possible (for each observation in turn),
            preferably using a specified random seed to allow replication.</p>

          <p>The effect of the number of permutations is typically marginal relative to the default
            of 999. In our example, selecting 99999 results in two minor changes, but the total
            number of significant locations remains the same. As shown in
            Figure <a href="#fig:localmoransig99999">8</a>, there are now 21 locations significant
            at p &lt; 0.05, four at p &lt; 0.01, three at p &lt; 0.001, and one at p &lt; 0.00001, as illustrated

          <p>The cluster map is affected in the same two locations, but now we can assess the
            effect on the four classifications. As illustrated in right panel of Figure <a
              href="#fig:localmoransig99999">8</a>, one of the High-Low spatial outliers disappears
            (adjoining the large Low-Low cluster in the south of the country, it was significant at p &lt; 0.05 for 999
            permutations), and one new High-High cluster is added (to the west of the existing
            High-High cluster in the Brittany region, also significant at p &lt; 0.05). In general, it is good practice
            to assess the sensitivity of the significant locations to the number of permutations, although this
            typically only affects locations with a p-value of 0.05 (see below, for further
            discussion of the interpretation of significance).</p>

      <h2>Clusters and Spatial Outliers</h2>
      <p>Before moving on to a discussion of significance, we highlight the connection between
        the Moran scatter plot and the cluster map. As discussed previously, the Moran scatter
        plot provides a classification of spatial association into four categories, corresponding
        to the location of the points in the four quadrants of the plot. These categories are
        referred to as High-High, Low-Low, Low-High and High-Low, relative to the mean, which
        is the center of the graph. It is important to keep in mind that there is a difference
        between a location (and its spatial lag) being in a given quadrant of the plot, and
        that location being a <em>significant</em> local cluster or spatial outlier.</p>
      <div id="clusters" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Clusters</h3>
        <p>To illustrate this point, in the left panel of Figure <a href="#fig:donathighhigh">11</a>, we select all the
          locations in the upper right quadrant of
          the Moran scatter plot. Using the <em>linking</em> feature, they are immediately highlighted in the
          corresponding cluster map in the right panel of the Figure. The selection is indicated by the red colors in
          the map, as
          well as the grey areas that match locations in the plot that are not significant in the
          map. Whereas there were 22 points selected in the scatter plot, there were only
          nine locations on the map that were significant (at p &lt; 0.05).</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:donathighhigh"></span>

            Figure 11: High-High Moran scatter plot locations
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>This can also be illustrated using the reverse logic, starting in the cluster map, by selecting
          those locations identified as significant High-High cluster centers. In
          the right hand panel of Figure <a href="#fig:donatshihi">12</a>, this is accomplished
          by clicking on the red rectangle in the legend, next to High-High. All the corresponding
          cluster centers are shown in red on the map, whereas the other locations are more transparent.
          Through linking, we can identify the matching nine points in the Moran scatter plot in
          the left hand panel.</p>

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>To get a better sense of what these high-high clusters represent, we now link the significant
          locations in the cluster map with our original natural breaks map (Figure <a href="#fig:donatnatbreak">1</a>).
          In the left hand panel of Figure <a href="#fig:hihiinmap">13</a>, we show both the cluster centers (with blue
          outlines) as well as their neighbors.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The
          notion of a cluster is not always intuitive. Whereas in general, the selected
          locations correspond to darker colors, at times they are surrounded by light-colored observations
          as well. It should be kept in mind that the Local Moran statistic is constructed from the average of
          the neighbors, which is sensitive to the effect of outliers (e.g., a very large neighbor value pulling
          the overall average up).</p>

        <p>We can apply the same perspective to the Low-Low cluster locations, which correspond to points in the lower
          left quadrant of the Moran scatter plot. In Figure <a href="#fig:donatslolo1">14</a>, all 45 selected points
          are shown
          in the left hand panel. In the cluster map on the right, only 17 of those observations are actually
          significant,
          with a large swath of observations in the north and east not reaching that level.</p>

        <p>Again, we can identify the locations that are significance Low-Low clusters by clicking on the dark blue
          rectangle in the legend. The matching 17 observations in the lower-left quadrant of the Moran scatter plot

          locations with the lighted

        <h3>Multiple comparisons</h3>
        <p>An important methodological issue associated with the local spatial autocorrelation
          statistics is the selection of the p-value cut-off to properly reflect the desired
          Type I error. Not only are the pseudo p-values not analytical, since they are the result of a
          computational permutation process, but they also suffer from the problem of
          <em>multiple comparisons</em> <span class="citation">(for a detailed discussion, see de Castro and Singer <a

              role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.
          The bottom line is that a traditional choice of 0.05 is likely to lead to many
          false positives, i.e., rejections of the null when in fact it holds.
        </p>
        <p>There is no completely satisfactory solution to this problem, and no strategy yields an
          unequivocal <em>correct</em> p-value. A number of approximations have been suggested in the
          literature, and we consider here the <em>Bonferroni bounds</em> and <em>False Discovery Rate</em> approaches.
          However, in general, the preferred strategy is to carry out an extensive sensitivity
          analysis, to yield insight into what may be termed <em>interesting</em> locations.</p>
        <p>In <code>GeoDa</code> these strategies are implemented through the <strong>Significance Filter</strong>, the

            choosing 0.01 immediately
            changes the locations that are displayed in the significance and cluster maps, as
            shown in Figure <a href="#fig:localmorancluster01">23</a>. Now, there are only eight significant locations,
            compared to 29 with a pseudo p-value cut-off of 0.05.</p>

          <p>The point of departure is
            to set a target <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> value for an overall Type I error rate. In a
            multiple
            comparison context, this is sometimes referred to as the Family Wide Error Rate (FWER).
            The target rate is selected in the
            input box next to <strong>Input significance</strong>. Without any other options, this is
            the cut-off p-value used to select the observations. For example, this could be
            set to 0.1, a value suggested by <span class="citation">Efron and Hastie (<a href="#ref-EfronHastie:16"
                role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> for <em>big data analysis</em>.
            In our example, since the 85 observations hardly constitute <em>big</em> data, we keep the value at 0.01.
          </p>
          <p>We now consider the two more refined options, i.e., the <strong>Bonferroni bound</strong> and the
            <strong>False Discovery Rate</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="bonferroni-bound" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Bonferroni bound</h4>
          <p>The first custom option in the inference settings dialog is the <strong>Bonferroni bound</strong>
            procedure. This constructs a bound on the overall p-value by taking <span
              class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and
            dividing it by the number of multiple comparisons. In our context, the latter
            corresponds to the number of observations, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. As a result, Bonferroni
            bound
            would be <span class="math inline">\(\alpha / n = 0.00012\)</span>, the cut-off p-value to be used to
            determine significance.</p>
          <p>Note that in their recent overview of computer age statistical inference,
            <span class="citation">Efron and Hastie (<a href="#ref-EfronHastie:16" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>
            suggest the use of the term <em>interesting</em> observations, rather than
            signficant, which we will adopt as well.
          </p>
          <p>Checking the Bonferroni bound radio button in the
            dialog updates the significance and cluster maps. Only one
            observation meets this criterion in the sense that its pseudo p-value is
            less than the cut off, which is confirmed by the cluster map shown
            in Figure <a href="#fig:localmoranbonf">26</a>.</p>

          <h4>False Discovery Rate (FDR)</h4>
          <p>A slightly less conservative option is to use the False Discovery Rate (FDR), first
            proposed by <span class="citation">Benjamini and Hochberg (<a href="#ref-BenjaminiHochberg:95"
                role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>.
            To illustrate this method, we add some columns to the data table. First, we sort
            the p-values in increasing order, and add a variable to reflect that order, e.g.,
            the variable <strong>I</strong> shown in Figure <a href="#fig:fdrtable">27</a>,
            computed in the <strong>Table Calculator</strong> as <strong>Special &gt; Enumerate</strong>.</p>
          <p>Next, we create a new variable (FDR) that equals <span class="math inline">\(i \times \alpha / n\)</span>,
            where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the
            sequence number of the sorted observations (not the original observation order),
            <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the target, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the
            number of observations.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In our example,
            <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is 0.01 and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is 85, so
            that <span class="math inline">\(1 \times 0.01 / 85 = 0.000118\)</span> is the first entry.
            The second entry is <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 0.01 / 85 = 0.000235\)</span>, etc., as illustrated
            in the <strong>FDR</strong>
            column in the
            table shown in Figure <a href="#fig:fdrtable">27</a>.

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>We now determine the p-value in the sorted list that corresponds
            with the sequence number <span class="math inline">\(i_{max}\)</span>, the largest
            value for which <span class="math inline">\(p_{i_{max}} \leq i \times \alpha / n\)</span>. In the table with
            the sorted p-values,
            we can see how the first three observations meet the criterion, but for the fourth
            observation, the pseudo p-value is larger than the value in the FDR column.
            Consequently, this criterion identifies three locations as significant. Checking the
            False Discovery Rate radio button will update the signficance and cluster maps
            accordingly, displaying only three significant locations, as shown
            in Figure <a href="#fig:fdrcluster">28</a>.</p>

        <h3>Interpretation of significance</h3>
        <p>As mentioned, there is no fully satisfactory solution to deal with the multiple
          comparison problem. Therefore, it is recommended to carry out a sensitivity analysis
          and to identify the stage where the results become <em>interesting</em>. A mechanical use of
          0.05 as a cut off value is definitely <em>not</em> the proper way to proceed.</p>
        <p>Also, for the
          Bonferroni and FDR procedures to work properly, it is necessary to have a large number of permutations, to
          ensure that the minimum p-value can be less than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha / n\)</span>.
          Currently, the largest number of permutations that GeoDa supports is 99999, so that
          in order to be meaningful, we must have at least <span class="math inline">\(\alpha / n \gt 0.00001\)</span>.
          Otherwise, the Bonferroni criterion
          cannot yield a single significant value. This is not due to a characteristic of the
          data, but to the lack of sufficient permutations to yield a pseudo p-value that
          is small enough.</p>
        <p>In practice, this means that with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.01\)</span>, data sets with
          <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 1000\)</span> will not have a significant location using the Bonferroni
          criterion. With
          <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span>, this value increases to 5000, and with
          <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.1\)</span> to 10,000. However, for truly large data sets, an
          uncritical application of the Bonferroni bounds will not give meaningful results.

      <div id="interpretation-of-clusters" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Interpretation of clusters</h3>
        <p>Strictly speaking, the locations shown as significant on the significance and cluster maps are
          not the actual <em>clusters</em>, but the <em>cores</em> of a cluster. In contrast, in the case of spatial
          outliers, they are the actual locations of interest.</p>
        <p>In order to get a better sense
          of the spatial extent of the cluster, there are a number of ways to highlight cores,
          their neighbors, or both in the <strong>Select All…</strong> option in Figure <a
            href="#fig:selectalloption">29</a>.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:selectalloption"></span>
          <img src="pics6a/4_007_coresoptions.png" alt="Cores and neighbors option" width="25%" />
          <p class="caption">
            Figure 29: Cores and neighbors option
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>The first option selects the cores, i.e., all the locations shown as non-white in the
          map. This is not so much relevant for the cluster or significance map, but rather for
          any maps that are linked. The selection of the <strong>Cores</strong> will select the corresponding
          observations in any other map or graph window.</p>
        <p>The next option does not select the cores themselves, but their neighbors. Again, this
          is most relevant when used in combination with linked maps or graphs.</p>
        <p>The third option selects both the cores and their neighbors (as defined by the
          spatial weights). This is most useful to assess the spatial range of the areas
          identified as <em>clusters</em>. For example, with the p-value set at 0.01, selection of the
          cores and neighbors yields the regions in Figure <a href="#fig:coresneighbors">30</a>, with the
          non-significant neighbors
          shown in grey.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:coresneighbors"></span>
          <img src="pics6a/4_569_coresandneighbors.png" alt="Cluster cores and neighbors (p&lt;0.01)" width="60%" />
          <p class="caption">
            Figure 30: Cluster cores and neighbors (p&lt;0.01)
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>An interesting application of this feature is to superimpose the cores and neighbors
          selected for a given p-value, say 0.01, onto the cluster cores identified with a different
          p-value, say 0.05. In the example in Figure <a href="#fig:linkedcores">31</a>, the cores and clusters for 0.01
          mostly match
          the locations identified as cluster cores at p &lt; 0.05. In our example, there are 23
          locations selected, compared to 26 significant High-High and Low-Low locations for
          p &lt; 0.05. The major difference is that the High-High region in the center of the
          country is totally missed, but the High-High cluster in Brittany and the Low-Low
          cluster in the south of the country is almost exactly matched.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:linkedcores"></span>

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Similarly, checking the cores and neighbors selected in the significance map, clearly
          illustrates how some of the neighbors at p &lt; 0.01 are identified as significant
          cores for p &lt; 0.05, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:linkedsigcores">32</a>.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:linkedsigcores"></span>

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>In sum, this drives home the message that a mechanical application of p-values is
          to be avoided. Instead, a careful sensitivity analysis should be carried out, comparing cores of clusters
          identified for different p-values, including the Bonferroni and FDR criteria, as well
          as the associated neighbors to suggest <em>interesting</em> locations that may suggest
          new hypotheses or <em>discover the unexpected</em>.</p>

      <h2>Conditional Local Cluster Maps</h2>
      <p>A final option for the Local Moran statistic is that the cluster maps can be
        incorporated in a conditional map view, similar to the conditional maps we
        covered earlier. This is accomplished by selecting the <strong>Show As Conditional Map</strong>
        item as the fourth entry in the options, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:localrandomizationoption">7</a>.</p>
      <p>The resulting dialog is the same as for the standard conditional map we reviewed
        in an earlier chapter. In our example, we take
        literacy (<strong>Litercy</strong>) as the conditioning variable for the x-axis, and <strong>Clergy</strong> as
        the conditioning variable for the y-axis. In addition, we change the default 3 by 3
        micromaps to a 2 by 2 setup, selecting the median as the cut point for each variable
        (select quantile &gt; 2).</p>
      <p>The result is as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:localcondmaps">33</a>, depicting four micromaps. The maps on the
        left show the location of clusters and outliers (using p &lt; 0.05 in this example) for those
        departments with literacy below the median, whereas the maps on the right show the
        corresponding departments above the median. The main difference seems to be between
        the maps on the lower end of clergy versus the upper end. The upper end seems to have
        more High-High cluster cores, with the lower end with more Low-Low cores.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that this example is purely illustrative of the functionality available through
        the conditional cluster map feature, rather than as a substantive interpretation. As
        always, the main focus is on whether the micromaps suggest different patterns, which
        would imply an interaction effect with the conditioning variables.</p>
