      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In this Chapter, we will explore a range of mapping and geovisualization options. We start with a review of
        common thematic map classifications and the way these are implemented in <code>GeoDa</code>. We next focus on
        different statistical maps, in particular maps that are designed to
        highight extreme values or outliers. We also illustrate maps for categorical variables
        (unique value maps), and their extension to multiple categories in the form
        of co-location maps. We close with a review of some special approaches to geovisualization, i.e., conditional
        maps, the cartogram and map animation.</p>
      <p>Even though there is substantial mapping functionality in <code>GeoDa</code>, it is worth noting that it is
        <em>not</em> a cartographic software. The main objective is to use the maps as part of a framework
        of <em>dynamic graphics</em>, to interact with the data as part of the exploration process. As a result, maps in
        <code>GeoDa</code> do not have some standard cartographic features, such as a directional arrow, or a scale bar.
        However, any map can be saved as an image file for further manipulation in specialized graphics software.

        <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
        <p>We will illustrate the various operations by means of the data set with demographic and socio-economic
          information for 55 New York City sub-boroughs that comes built-in with <code>GeoDa</code>. It is also
          contained in the <a href="https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/">GeoDa Center data set collection</a>.

        <p><br></p>
        <p>Since the data set is built-in, there is no real need to download the sample data, although it is useful in

      <h2>Thematic Maps – Overview</h2>
      <p>We start by closing any current project and load the NYC sub-borough data set from the <strong>Sample
          Data</strong> tab in the <strong>Connect to Data Source</strong> dialog. One click on the NYC Data icon brings
        up the green themeless map, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:nycbase">1</a>. Alternatively, we can load the
        downloaded <strong>nyc.shp</strong> file.</p>

      <p>We ignore the <strong>Rates-Calculated Maps</strong> item for now, which will be considered in the next
        Chapter. Among the other map types, there are four where an additional choice is required (the right pointing
        arrow) consisting of the number of intervals to be specified (choose the number
        from a drop down list). All the other options have pre-specified settings.</p>
      <p>Common map classifications include the <strong>Quantile Map</strong>, <strong>Natural Breaks Map</strong>, and
        <strong>Equal Intervals Map</strong>. Specialized classifications that are designed to bring out
        extreme values include the <strong>Percentile Map</strong>, <strong>Box Map</strong> (with two options for the
        hinge), and the <strong>Standard Deviation Map</strong>. The <strong>Unique Values Map</strong> does not involve
        a classification algorithm, since it uses the integer values of a categorical variable itself as the map
        categories. The
        <strong>Co-location Map</strong> is an extension of this principle to multiple categorical variables.
        Finally, <strong>Custom Breaks</strong> allows for the use of customized classifications by means
        of the <strong>Category Editor</strong>.

          <h4>Quantile map</h4>
          <p>A quantile map is based on sorted values for a variable that are then grouped into
            bins that each have the same number of observations, the so-called quantiles. The number of bins
            corresponds to the particular quantile, e.g., five bins for a <em>quintile</em> map, or four bins
            for a <em>quartile</em> map, two of the most commonly used categories.</p>
          <p>To illustrate this functionality, we select
            <strong>Quantile Map &gt; 4</strong> from the list of options shown
            in Figure <a href="#fig:quantileoption">4</a> to create a <em>quartile</em> map (four categories).

          <p>Upon closer examination, something doesn’t seem to be quite right. With 55 total observations, we should
            expect roughly 14 (55/4 = 13.75) observations in each group. But the first group only has 7, and the third
            group has 19!</p>
          <p>This illustrates a common problem with quantile maps
            whenever ties are present. If we open up the <strong>Table</strong> (click on the table icon if it is not
            open) and sort on the variable <strong>rent2008</strong> (click on the field name), we see in Figure <a
              href="#fig:tiestable">7</a> where the problem lies.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Ignoring the zero entries for now (those are a potential problem in their own right),
            we see that observations starting in row 8 up to row 21 all have a value of 1000. The cut-off
            for the first quartile is at 14, highlighted in yellow in the graph. In a non-spatial analysis, this is not
            an issue, the first quartile value is given as 1000. But in a map, the observations are locations that need
            to be assigned to a group (with a separate color). Other than an arbitrary assignment, there is no way to
            classify observations with a rent of 1000 in either category 1 or category 2. To deal with these
            <em>ties</em>, GeoDa moves all the observations with a value of 1000 to the second category. As a result,
            even though the value of the first quartile is given as 1000 in the map legend, only those observations with
            rents <em>less than</em> 1000 are included in the first quartile category. As we see from the table, there
            are seven such observations.</p>
          <p>Any time there are ties in the ranking of observations that align with the values for the breakpoints, the
            classification in a quantile map will be problematic and result in categories with an unequal number of
            observations.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="natural-breaks-map" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Natural breaks map</h4>
          <p>A natural breaks map uses a nonlinear algorithm to group observations such that
            the within-group homogeneity is maximized, following the pathbreaking work of
            <span class="citation">Fisher (<a href="#ref-Fisher:58" role="doc-biblioref">1958</a>)</span> and <span
              class="citation">Jenks (<a href="#ref-Jenks:77" role="doc-biblioref">1977</a>)</span>. In essence, this is
            a clustering algorithm in one dimension to determine the break points that yield groups with the largest
            internal similarity.
          </p>
          <p>To create such a map with four categories, we select <strong>Natural Breaks Map &gt; 4</strong> from the
            list of options and again choose <strong>rent2008</strong> as the variable, in the same way as for the
            quantile map. This yields a natural breaks map, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:natbreaks">8</a>.</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:natbreaks"></span>

          </div>
          <p>In comparison to the quartile map, the natural breaks criterion is better at grouping the extreme
            observations. The three observations with zero values make up the first category, whereas the five high rent
            areas in Manhattan make up the top category. Note also that in contrast to the quantile maps, the number of
            observations in each category can be highly unequal.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="equal-intervals-map" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Equal intervals map</h4>
          <p>An equal intervals map uses the same principle as a histogram to organize the observations
            into categories that divide the range of the variable into equal interval bins. This
            contrasts with the quantile map, where the number of observations in each bin is equal, but the
            range for each bin is not. For
            the equal interval classification, the value range between the lower and upper bound
            in each bin is constant across bins, but the number of observations in each
            bin is typically not equal.</p>
          <p>Using
            <strong>Equal Intervals Map &gt; 4</strong> and <strong>rent2008</strong> for the variable provides the
            result
            illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:eqinterval">9</a>.

          </div>
          <p>As in the case of natural breaks, the equal interval approach can yield categories with highly unequal
            numbers of observations. In our example, the three zero observations again get grouped in the first
            category, but the second range (from 725 to 1450) contains the bulk of the spatial units (42).</p>
          <p>To illustrate the similarity with the histogram, we select <strong>Explore &gt; Histogram</strong> for
            <strong>rent2008</strong> and set the <strong>Choose Intervals</strong> option to <strong>4</strong>. Also,
            set <strong>View &gt; Display Statistics</strong>. The resulting histogram in Figure <a
              href="#fig:eqinthist">10</a> has the exact same ranges for each interval as the equal intervals map. The
            number of observations in each category is the same as well. The values for the
            number of observations in the descriptive statistics below the graph match the values given
            in parentheses in the map legend.</p>

          <p>Finally, we illustrate the equivalence between the two graphs by selecting a category in the map legend.
            To accomplish this, we click on the rectangle in the map legend associated with the chosen category.
            In the right-hand panel of Figure <a href="#fig:linkmapeqint">11</a>, this is shown for the highest category
            (the dark brown rectangle in the legend). This selects the corresponding observations in the map, and,
            through linking, in the histogram as well (left-hand panel in Figure <a href="#fig:linkmapeqint">11</a>). As
            expected, the selected bins match completely.</p>

          <h4>Map base layer (base map)</h4>
          <p>The choropleth maps created by <code>GeoDa</code> are abstractions and lack context. To provide some
            context, a base layer can be added behind the map. The base layer is similar to a Google map, and
            contains roads, rivers and lakes, and other recognizable geographic features. Currently, <code>GeoDa</code>
            supports a number of base layers from several sources.
            The various options are listed in a dialog
            that is activated after clicking on the <strong>Base Map</strong> icon in the map toolbar, as shown
            in Figure <a href="#fig:maplayeroptions">14</a>. The default setting is <strong>No Basemap</strong>.</p>

          <p>For each provider, different types of base layers are available. For example, for Carto, this is

            and <strong>Carto Dark</strong>, as well as these types without labels. For ESRI, the options are
            <strong>WorldStreetMap</strong>,
            <strong>WorldTopoMap</strong>, <strong>WorldTerrain</strong> and <strong>Ocean</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>For example, the default map created by selecting <strong>Carto Light</strong> (as in Figure <a

            is illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:cartolight1">15</a> for the natural breaks map of the rent data. Note
            that, in practice, it may be necessary to
            adjust the zoom level to get a satisfactory framing of the map and the base layer.<a href="#fn2"

          <p>The relative transparency of the base layer versus the choropleth map can be adjusted by means

            transparency of the base layer (a smaller value gives more importance to the choropleth map relative to the
            base layer).
            In the example shown in Figure <a href="#fig:transparency">16</a>, we have moved the slider from its
            starting
            value of 0.69 over to 0.10, in order to make the map itself more pronounced.</p>

          <h4>Other map options</h4>
          <p>The remainig three options pertain to the look of the map view. <strong>Show Status Bar</strong> is on by
            default, which means that the number of observations, the number of selected observations, etc., will be
            displayed on the status bar. The <strong>Selection Shape</strong> is set by default to
            <strong>Rectangle</strong>, with the other two options as <strong>Circle</strong> and <strong>Line</strong>.
            This allows for the selection of observations on the map that lie within the specified shape, as drawn
            by the pointer. As we have seen earlier, through the process of linking, any selection is instantaneously
            identified in all other views as well.</p>
          <p>Finally, the <strong>Color</strong> options determine how the map is displayed. By default, the polygon
            outlines (i.e., in our example, the boundaries of the sub-borough neighborhoods) are shown, with
            <strong>Outlines Visible</strong> checked, as in Figure <a href="#fig:outlines">23</a>.</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:outlines"></span>

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>By unchecking this option, the outlines disappear. This is particularly helpful when the map contains many
            small areas that will tend to be dominated by their boundary lines. In our example in
            Figure <a href="#fig:mapnooutlines">24</a>, this results in an
            impression of larger regions, because many adjoining sub-boroughs ended up in the same
            category of the natural breaks classification.</p>

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>One further option is to
            <strong>Show Map Boundary</strong>, only available with <strong>Outlines Visible</strong> turned
            <strong>off</strong>. This option is particularly useful when only a few polygons are
            colored in a map with many observations, for example, in the local cluster maps
            we will consider in a later chapter. Turning off the outlines in such an instance makes the polygons
            floating in white space. With the <strong>Show Map Boundary</strong> option turned on, the initial outline
            of the map is retained.
          </p>
          <p>The <strong>Background Color</strong> determines the background against which the map is drawn. In most
            instances, the default of white is the best choice.</p>

      <h2>Extreme Value Maps</h2>
      <p>Extreme value maps are variations of common choropleth maps where the classification
        is designed to highlight extreme values at the lower and upper end of the scale, with
        the goal of identifying <em>outliers</em>. These maps were developed in the spirit of
        <em>spatializing EDA</em>, i.e., adding spatial features to commonly used approaches in
        non-spatial EDA <span class="citation">(Anselin <a href="#ref-Anselin:94" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span>.
      </p>
      <p><code>GeoDa</code> currently supports three such map types in the <strong>Map</strong> menu: a percentile map,
        a box map, and a
        standard deviation map. These are briefly described below. Only their distinctive features are highlighted,
        since they share all the same options with the other choropleth map types.</p>
      <div id="percentile-map" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Percentile map</h3>
        <p>The percentile map is a variant of a quantile map that would start off with 100 categories. However, rather
          than having these 100 categories, the map classification is reduced to six ranges, the lowest 1%, 1-10%,
          10-50%, 50-90%, 90-99% and the top 1%. This is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:percentmap">25</a> for the
          <strong>rent2008</strong> variable. We select <strong>Map &gt; Percentile Map</strong> from the map menu or
          the map toolbar icon and choose the variable to create the map.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:percentmap"></span>

          <p class="caption">
            Figure 25: Percentile map
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Note how the extreme values are much better highlighted, especially at the upper end of the distribution. The
          classification also illustrates some common problems with this type of map. First of all, since there are
          fewer than 100 observations, in a strict sense there is no 1% of the distribution. This is handled
          (arbitrarily) by rounding, so that the highest category has one observation, but the lowest does not have any.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, since the values are sorted from low to high to determine the cut points, there can be an issue
          with ties. As we have seen, this is a generic problem for all quantile maps. As pointed out,
          <code>GeoDa</code> handles ties by moving observations to the next highest category. For example, when there
          are a lot of observations with zero values (e.g., in the crime rate map for the U.S. counties), the lowest
          percentile can easily end up without observations, since all the zeros will be moved to the next category.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="box-map" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Box map</h3>
        <p>A box map <span class="citation">(Anselin <a href="#ref-Anselin:94" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span> is
          the mapping counterpart of the idea behind a box plot. The point of departure
          is again a quantile map, more specifically, a <em>quartile</em> map. But the four categories are extended to
          six bins, to separately identify the lower and upper outliers. The definition of outliers is a function of a
          multiple of the
          inter-quartile range (IQR), the difference between the values for the 75 and 25 percentile. As we will see in
          a
          later chapter in our discussion of the box plot, we use two options for these cut-off values, or
          <em>hinges</em>, 1.5 and 3.0.
          The box map uses the same convention.</p>
        <p>For example, we invoke this map using <strong>Map &gt; Box Map (Hinge=1.5)</strong> from the menu or the map
          icon on the toolbar. After selecting <strong>rent2008</strong> as the variable, the map
          shown in Figure <a href="#fig:boxmap">26</a> is created.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:boxmap"></span>

            Figure 26: Box map, hinge=1.5
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Compared to the quartile map in Figure <a href="#fig:quartmap">6</a>, the box map in Figure <a
            href="#fig:boxmap">26</a> separates the three lower outliers (the observations with zero values) from
          the other four observations in the first quartile. They are depicted in dark blue. Similarly,
          it separates the six outliers in Manhattan from the eight other observations in the upper quartile. The upper
          outliers are colored dark red.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the correspondence between the box plot and the box map, we put the two side by side
          (<strong>Explore &gt; Box Plot</strong>) in Figure <a href="#fig:boxmapoutliers">27</a>. In the right-hand
          panel, we select the upper outliers in the box plot. Only the matching six outlier locations in the box map
          are highlighted. Note that the outliers in the box plot do not provide any information on the fact that these
          locations are also adjoining in space. This the <em>spatial</em> perspective that the <em>box map</em> adds
          to the data exploration.</p>

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>From the current map, we can switch the box map between the hinge criterion of 1.5 and 3.0 by opening
          the options menu (right click on the map) and selecting
          <strong>Change Current Map Type &gt; Box Map (Hinge = 3.0)</strong>. Alternatively, we can also open a new map
          window from the main menu or map toolbar icon and select <strong>Box Map (Hinge=3.0)</strong> as the option.
          The resulting box map, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:boxmap3">28</a>, no longer has lower outliers and has
          only five upper outliers (compared to six for the 1.5 hinge).

      </div>
      <div id="standard-deviation-map" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Standard deviation map</h3>
        <p>The third type of extreme values map is a standard deviation map. In some way, this
          is a parametric counterpart to the box map, in that the standard deviation is used as
          the criterion to identify outliers, instead of the inter-quartile range.</p>
        <p>In a standard deviation map, the variable under consideration is transformed to standard deviational units
          (with mean 0 and standard deviation 1). This is equivalent to the z-standardization we have seen before.</p>
        <p>The number of categories in the classification depends on the range of values, i.e., how many standard
          deviational units cover the range from lowest to highest. It is also quite common that some categories do not
          contain any observations (as in the
          example in Figure <a href="#fig:standardmap">29</a>).</p>
        <p>We continue with the variable <strong>rent2008</strong> and bring up a standard deviation map by means
          of <strong>Map &gt; Standard Deviation Map</strong> from the main menu or from the map toolbar icon.</p>

        <p>In the map in Figure <a href="#fig:standardmap">29</a>, there are five neighborhoods with median rent more
          than two standard deviations above the mean, and three with a median rent less than two standard deviations
          below the mean. Both sets would be labeled outliers in standard statistical practice. Also, note how the
          second lowest
          category does not contain any observations (so the corresponding color is not present in
          the map).</p>

      <h2>Mapping Categorical Variables</h2>
      <p>So far, our maps have pertained to continuous variables, with a clear order from low to high.
        <code>GeoDa</code> also contains some functionality to map categorical variables, for which the numerical values
        are distinct, but not necessarily meaningful in and of themselves. Most importantly, the numerical values
        typically do not imply any ordering of the categories. The two relevant functions in <code>GeoDa</code> are the
        <em>unique value map</em>, for a single variable, and the <em>co-location map</em>, where the categories for
        multiple variables are compared.
      </p>
      <div id="unique-value-map" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Unique Value map</h3>
        <p>To illustrate the categorical map, we first create a box map (with hinge 1.5) for each of the
          variables <strong>kids2000</strong> (the percentage households with kids under 18) and
          <strong>pubast00</strong> (the percentage households receiving public assistance). In each of these maps, we
          save the
          categories (<strong>Save Categories</strong> in the options menu), respectively as <strong>kidscat</strong>
          and <strong>asstcat</strong>. The category labels go from 1 to 6, but not all categories necessarily
          have observations. For example, the map for public assistance does not have either lower
          (label 1) or higher (label 6), outliers, only observations for 2–5. For the kids map,
          we have categories 1–5.</p>
        <p>At this point, we ignore the meaning of the categories and create a categorical map for the
          classifications in the box map for the <strong>kidscat</strong> variable by means of <strong>Map &gt; Unique
            Value Map</strong>
          from the main menu or from the map toolbar icon. This yields the map shown in Figure <a
            href="#fig:uniquemap">30</a>.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:uniquemap"></span>
          <img src="pics3a/22_kidscat.png" alt="Unique value map" width="60%" />
          <p class="caption">
            Figure 30: Unique value map
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>The categorical map has values in the legend from 1 to 5, but unlike for the box map from which they
          originated, they do not imply any ordering. This is also reflected in the colors, which are generated from the
          <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&amp;scheme=Accent&amp;n=3">ColorBrewer categorical map
            palette</a>.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to change the colors for the categories. This is carried out by dragging the
          legend label up or down (the category value to the right, not the rectangle on the left). In the example in
          Figure <a href="#fig:draglabel1">31</a>, we drag the label 5 (associated with the rosy color) up to the next
          level, where the color is green and the label is 4.</p>

            Figure 31: Switching categories
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>As soon as we release the label, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:draglabel2">32</a>, it becomes 4 again. This
          emphasizes that the label in and
          of itself is meaningless in terms of value.</p>

        </div>
        <p>As a result of the switch in labels, all observations that used to be colored rosy
          (or, labeled 5)
          in Figure <a href="#fig:uniquemap">30</a> are now colored dark green (and, labeled 4), and
          vice versa, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:uniquemap2">33</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p>It is important to
          keep in mind that in a categorical map, the labels have no meaning other than to
          distinguish between categories. So, whether we label the same group as 5 or 4 is irrelevant, only the grouping
          matters.
          Furthermore, the values in the legend are
          represented as integers for convenience, but they could just as well have been A, B, C, etc.,
          or other descriptors. This is a fundamental difference between the categorical maps and the
          other choropleth map types.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="co-location-map" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Co-location map</h3>
        <p>The idea behind a co-location map is the extension of the unique value map concept to a multivariate
          context. In essence, it is the implementation of ideas related to the principles of <em>map overlay</em> or
          <em>map algebra</em> applied to categorical maps.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>In a co-location map, the labels for different categorical
          variables are compared and the matches identified on the map.
          It is up to the user to ensure that the categories across variables are meaningful, since the
          <em>co-location</em> is based on the variables having the same code. For example, this is useful when
          comparing the extent to which
          the quartiles across different variables occur at the same locations. Or, as we will see
          later, whether significant patterns of local spatial autocorrelation match across several
          variables. But it is also very easy to generate nonsensical results, for example, when the labels are
          not comparable.</p>
        <p>The co-location map is invoked as <strong>Map &gt; Co-location Map</strong> from the main menu or from the
          map toolbar icon. This brings up a dialog, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:colocationvars">34</a>, that allows
          for the selection of the different categorical variables in the top panel. If there are matches between the
          codes for the variables, these are displayed at the bottom, with the labels and a proposed color scheme.</p>
        <p>In our example, we select <strong>kidscat</strong> and <strong>asstcat</strong> as the two categories we want
          to compare. Four <em>labels</em> match between the two variables, and their values and a proposed color theme
          are listed in the bottom panel of Figure <a href="#fig:colocationvars">34</a>.</p>

        <p>The proposed color scheme is <strong>Unique Values</strong> by default. But in this example, that is not the
          appropriate shading, since we are comparing the classifications between two box maps (or, equivalently, box
          plots). The <strong>Select color scheme</strong> drop down list provides a set of pre-coded color schemes for
          a range of likely comparisons between categories. For our example, we select
          <strong>Box Map</strong>, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:colorscheme">35</a>.

          means of a scatter plot (see the chapter on EDA), the co-location map can be applied to categorical variables.
          It can also easily be extended to more than two variables.</p>

    <div id="custom-classifications" class="section level2 unnumbered" number="">
      <h2>Custom Classifications</h2>
      <p>In addition to the range of pre-defined classifications available for choropleth maps
        in <code>GeoDa</code>, it is also possible to create a custom classification. This is often useful
        when substantive concerns dictate the cut points, rather than data driven criteria.
        For example, this may be appropriate when specific income categories are specified for
        certain government programs.</p>
      <p>A custom classification may also be useful when comparing the spatial distribution of a
        variable over time. All included pre-defined classifications are relative and would be re-computed
        for each time period. For example, when mapping crime rates over time, in an era of
        declining rates, the observations in the upper quartile in a later period may have crime
        rates that correspond to a much lower category in an earlier period. This would not be
        apparent using the pre-defined approaches, but could be visualized by setting the same
        break points for each time period.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Category Editor</strong> in <code>GeoDa</code> is a complex tool that allows for the creation of a
        fully customized classification scheme. It is invoked from the map options menu, as
        <strong>Change Current Map Type &gt; Custom Breaks &gt; Create New Custom</strong>, as shown in Figure <a
          href="#fig:optioncreatecustom">38</a>.

      <p>Alternatively, the category editor can also be invoked directly by selecting
        the corresponding icon from the toolbar, immediately to the left of the histogram icon,
        shown in Figure <a href="#fig:customicon">39</a>.</p>

          <h4>Default setup</h4>
          <p>There are slight differences between the category editor dialog, depending on whether
            it is invoked from the toolbar, or as an option from an existing map. The main difference
            is that in the latter case, the associated map will be updated as a new classification is
            being developed. When invoked from the toolbar, this is not the case. We illustrate the
            map option in what follows.</p>
          <p>For example, in Figure <a href="#fig:customdialog1">40</a>, the <strong>Create New Custom</strong> option
            is invoked
            from a box map for the <strong>kids2000</strong> variable. The dialog requests a name for the new category
            and shows a five classification histogram with the corresponding box map colors (there are
            no observations for the upper outlier category). The default name suggested
            is <strong>Custom Breaks (kids2000)</strong>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
              id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

          </div>
          <p>We continue by specifying the name for the new classification as <strong>custom1</strong>, as in Figure <a
              href="#fig:custom1var">41</a>.</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:custom1var"></span>

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>After clicking <strong>OK</strong>, the category editor dialog is updated with the name for the new
            classification, which will appear in the drop down list below <strong>Create Custom Breaks</strong>.
            Note how the associated variable (<strong>Assoc Var.</strong>) is listed as <strong>kids2000</strong>, which
            is where the interface draws the values and category breakpoints from. When invoked from the toolbar,
            the associated variable will be the first variables in the data table (<strong>bor_sub</strong>), which is
            not always meaningful.</p>
          <p>The other settings in the dialog define the classification.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
              id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In Figure <a href="#fig:customdialog1">40</a>,
            this is <strong>User Defined</strong> for the <strong>Breaks</strong>, <strong>diverging</strong> for the
            <strong>Color Scheme</strong>, and <strong>6</strong> for
            the number of <strong>Categories</strong>. The panel on the right shows a histogram with the current
            classification applied to the associated variable. Moving the pointer over a bar in the
            histogram displays some summary statistics in the status bar, such as the range and its
            associated number of observations. Also, as soon as the custom editing process is initiated, the map from
            which it was
            started is synchronized with the current state of the category editor. In our example, initially, there
            is not change in the classification.</p>
          <p>Besides the number of categories, the two main criteria to define a new classification
            are the break points and the associated colors. Each item has a number of options in a
            drop down list. For the <strong>Breaks</strong>, the five options consist of four traditional
            criteria, and one <strong>User Defined</strong> item. The latter is the default, shown in Figure <a
              href="#fig:custombreaks">42</a>.</p>

        <div id="editing-break-points" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
          <h4>Editing break points</h4>
          <p>We are now ready to edit the break points. There are two approaches to carry this out.
            One is to use the handle in the vertical slider next to the list of button breaks.
            One break is dealt with at a time, selected by means of the matching radio button
            to the left. In our example, since we currently only have five effective categories,
            even though <strong>Categories</strong> is set to <strong>6</strong>, we start by adjusting the upper cut
            off
            point.</p>
          <p>With the <strong>Button break 5</strong> radio button checked, we move the slider up, which decreases
            the value of the last break point and starts to grow a sixth category on the right of the
            histogram. However, it is difficult to set a precise value. For example, in Figure <a
              href="#fig:breakslider">45</a>, it is set
            at <strong>49.984</strong>. As the slider moves up or down, the histogram (and the map) is
            instantaneously updated to reflect the new break points. With <strong>Automatic Labels</strong> checked
            (the default), the category labels are updated as well.</p>

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>A second, more effective approach to edit the break points is to type them in directly. For example,
            we enter 20, 30, 40, 45 and 50 as the new break points, to
            end up with the break points as given in Figure <a href="#fig:newbreaks">46</a>.
            Again,
            as new values are entered, the histogram, map and labels are updated.</p>

          <p>The corresponding map classification, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:newbreaksmap">47</a>, has the updated
            labels and categories. Note how the
            legend heading indicates the use of <strong>custom1</strong> as the classification for the variable
            <strong>kids2000</strong>.

          <p>Finally, even though in the current application it is not actually needed, we uncheck the
            <strong>Automatic Labels</strong> box to illustrate the custom labels feature. In the boxes, we enter
            <strong>cat1</strong>, <strong>cat2</strong>, etc. as the labels. The labels in the map in Figure <a
              href="#fig:customlabels">48</a>
            are updated accordingly.

      <div id="applications-of-custom-categories" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Applications of custom categories</h3>
        <p>Once created, the custom classification becomes available to any application where
          classification is involved. Most directly, this is the mapping functionality, where
          now the custom category will be listed as an option under the <strong>Custom Breaks</strong> when selecting
          <strong>Change Current Map Type</strong>. However, it currently cannot be used to create a map from
          scratch. In other words, one needs to first create a map using one of the built-in classifications,
          and then change the map type to the customized category.
        </p>
        <p>This <strong>custom1</strong> classification could be used to track the spatial distribution
          of the kids variable over time. For example, we can create a box map (with hinge 1.5) for
          the <strong>kids2005</strong> variable, and proceed with <strong>Change Current Map Type</strong> to select
          <strong>custom1</strong>.
          The resulting map, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:customkids2005">49</a>, reflects the new custom categories.
          We observe an overall shift towards the
          lower categories, i.e., more sub-boroughs have a smaller share of households with children in 2005 compared to
          2000.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:customkids2005"></span>

            Figure 49: kids2005 with custom classification
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>In addition, the custom classification becomes available to other graphs, such as the histogram and the
          conditional plots, covered in the chapter on EDA. In many ways, using customized break points is the
          preferred way to implement conditional plots (see also below).</p>
      </div>
      <div id="saving-the-custom-categories-the-project-file" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Saving the custom categories – the Project File</h3>
        <p><code>GeoDa</code> has the ability to save a so-called <strong>Project File</strong> that contains
          information on various variable transformations and other operations. We will revisit the project file in more
          detail when we discuss spatial weights. One useful feature of the project file is that it also contains the
          definition of any custom categories that were created. If this definition is not saved in a project file, then
          it will be lost, and will need to be recreated from scratch the next time the data set is analyzed.</p>
        <p>The project file is created from the menu as <strong>File &gt; Save Project</strong>, as in Figure <a
            href="#fig:projectfilemenu">50</a>.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:projectfilemenu"></span>

        </div>
        <p>This is followed by the usual file name dialog. The file is saved with a
          file extension of <strong>gda</strong>. It is a text file that includes XML encoding.
          For example, when we examine the just created project file with a text editor,
          we can locate the section pertaining to <strong>custom_classifications</strong>, as shown in
          Figure <a href="#fig:projectfilecontents">51</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The custom classification section contains all the aspects needed for the
          definition of the custom category.</p>
        <p>Once a project file has been saved, <code>GeoDa</code> should be started by loading the <strong>gda</strong>
          file, rather than the shape file or any other data set. This ensures that all the meta-information is taken
          into account, all variable transformations updated and custom categories stored. The options menu for any map,
          histogram or conditional plot will now contain <strong>custom1</strong> as one of the available categories.
        </p>
        <p>Once we move to more complex analyses, with multiple variable transformations, spatial weights, and other
          items created during various operations, the most efficient way to operate is to always save and use a project
          file.</p>

    <div id="conditional-map" class="section level2 unnumbered" number="">
      <h2>Conditional Map</h2>
      <p>We consider conditional plots more in depth in the treatment of EDA, but one option is
        to use a map. This is also known as
        a conditioned choropleth map, or a <em>micromap matrix</em>, discussed at length in
        <span class="citation">Carr and Pickle (<a href="#ref-CarrPickle:10" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. A
        micromap matrix is a matrix of maps that each pertain to a subset of the observations,
        determined by the <em>conditioning</em> variables on the horizontal and vertical axes. Each map shows the
        spatial distribution of the variable of interest, but only for those observations that fall into the
        associated categories of the conditioning variables.
      </p>
      <p>The main objective behind this conditioning is
        to detect any potential <em>interaction</em> between the conditioning variables and the topic of interest.
        The point of departure (or, null hypothesis) is that there is <em>no</em> interaction. If this were indeed
        the case, then the patterns shown on all the micromaps should be essentially the same. If there is
        interaction, then we would see high or low values of the variable of interest systematically associated
        with specific categories of the conditioning variables.</p>
      <p>This functionality is the first of the options associated with the conditional plot toolbar icon,
        illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:condmapicon">52</a>. Alternatively, it can be invoked from the menu
        as <strong>Map &gt; Conditional Map</strong>.</p>
      <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:condmapicon"></span>

      </div>
      <p>Selecting this option brings up a variable selection dialog containing three columns, as
        was the case for the conditional histogram plots.
        The first column pertains to the conditioning variable for the horizontal axis, the second defines the
        conditioning variable for the vertical axis. The third column, <strong>Map Theme</strong>, selects the variable
        that will be mapped.</p>
      <p>In our example, in Figure <a href="#fig:condmapvars">53</a>, we use <strong>forhis08</strong> (% of Hispanic
        population not born in the U.S.) and <strong>hhsiz08</strong> (average number of people per household) as the
        two conditioning variables, and <strong>rent2008</strong> (median rent) as the focus variable. All values are
        for 2008. Note that the second column also contains an <em>empty</em> category, which can be used when only
        conditioning on one dimension.</p>
      <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:condmapvars"></span>

          Figure 53: Conditional Map variable selection

      </div>
      <p>Clicking <strong>OK</strong> brings up the default conditional map, shown in
        Figure <a href="#fig:condmap3x3">54</a>. The matrix of micromaps contains three categories (quantiles) for each
        of the conditioning variables, and thus nine micromaps in total. On the horizontal axis,
        <strong>forhis08</strong> is listed with two break points. The vertical axis variable is given as
        <strong>hhsiz08</strong>, also with two break points. The maps themselves are box maps for the median rent
        variable. Each of the micro maps contains only those observations that match the categories on the horizontal
        and vertical axes.</p>
      <p>Note that, as in the other conditional plots, the break points listed may be slightly different
        from the quantiles given in a quantile map. This is to ensure that the categories are completely
        separated. For example, a quantile map with three categories for the horizontal conditional
        variable <strong>forhis08</strong> would give the first category ending at 31.829 and the second starting at
        31.972. The first breakpoint listed in the micromap matrix is 31.900, which is exactly the
        midpoint between the two values, ensuring complete separation.</p>

      <p>Since there are only 55 observations in our example, the sample size for each of the subsets tends to be very
        small. Therefore, we use the <strong>Options</strong> menu (right click) to change the classification. This menu
        includes
        the option to change the conditioning bins through <strong>Vertical Bins Breaks</strong> and <strong>Horizontal
          Bins Breaks</strong>. There are seven preset classifications, as well as the option to create custom breaks by
        means of the category editor. Note that if you continued with the previous example,
        the custom category <strong>custom1</strong> will be included as one of the <strong>Custom Breaks</strong>
        options.</p>
      <p>In the illustration in Figure <a href="#fig:condmap2x2">55</a>, the vertical and horizontal break points were
        changed from the default 3 quantiles, to 2. The result is a 2 x 2 matrix of micro maps</p>

      <p>The classification suggests that sub-boroughs with larger household size tend to have lower rents (the two maps
        at the top), whereas there does not seem to be an effect of the % Hispanic that is foreign-born (the maps on the
        left and right do not seem to be drastically different in the range of values they contain). By manipulating the
        break points, further insight can be gained into the presence of interaction effects (or lack thereof). This can
        be further investigated more formally by means of an analysis of variance.</p>

      <h2>Cartogram</h2>
      <div id="principle" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Principle</h3>
        <p>A cartogram is a map type where the original layout of the areal unit is replaced by a geometric
          form (usually a circle, rectangle, or hexagon) that is proportional to the value of the variable
          for the location. This is in contrast to a standard choropleth map, where the size of the polygon
          corresponds to the area of the location in question. The cartogram has a long history and many
          variants have been suggested, some quite creative. In essence, the construction of a cartogram
          is an example of a nonlinear optimization problem, where the geometric forms have to be located such that
          they reflect the topology (spatial arrangement) of the locations as closely as possible <span
            class="citation">(see Tobler <a href="#ref-Tobler:04" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>, for an extensive
            discussion of various aspects
            of the cartogram)</span>.</p>
        <p><code>GeoDa</code> implements a circular cartogram, in which the areal units are represented as circles,
          whose size (and color) is proportional to the value observed at that location.
          The changed shapes remove the misleading effect that the area of the unit might have on perception of
          magnitude.</p>
        <p>For example, in the case of median rent in NYC sub-boroughs, some of the smaller areas in Manhattan have the
          highest rent, and consequently
          they can barely be noticed in a standard choropleth map.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="creating-a-cartogram" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
        <h3>Creating a cartogram</h3>
        <p>The cartogram is invoked by its toolbar button, situated in the center of the three mapping icons
          (Figure <a href="#fig:cartogramicon">56</a>), or by selecting <strong>Map &gt; Cartogram</strong> in the
          <strong>Map</strong> menu.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:cartogramicon"></span>
          <img src="pics3a/6_295_cartogramicon.png" alt="Cartogram icon" width="15%" />
          <p class="caption">
            Figure 56: Cartogram icon
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Next follows the <strong>Cartogram Variables</strong> dialog that contains two columns, one for the
          <strong>Circle Size</strong> and one for the <strong>Circle Color</strong>. It is highly recommended to select
          the same variable for both. In our example, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:cartogramvars">57</a>, we again
          select <strong>rent2008</strong>.
          Note that the circle color variable can be different from the circle size variable, but then it may be
          difficult (and sometimes confusing) to keep the two separate.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:cartogramvars"></span>
          <img src="pics3a/6_296_cartogramvariables.png" alt="Cartogram variable selection" width="30%" />
          <p class="caption">
            Figure 57: Cartogram variable selection
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Clicking <strong>OK</strong> brings up the cartogram view. The default, shown in
          Figure <a href="#fig:defaultcartogram">58</a>, is to use the <strong>Box Map</strong> classification for the
          circle colors (with hinge at 1.5 IQR).
          Note how the multilayer and base map options are not available in a cartogram.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:defaultcartogram"></span>
          <img src="pics3a/22_cartogram.png" alt="Cartogram" width="60%" />
          <p class="caption">
            Figure 58: Cartogram
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>The cartogram is most insightful when used in conjunction with a regular choropleth map. Selecting an
          observation in the cartogram then immediately links it with the corresponding area in the choropleth map,
          illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:linkedcartogram">59</a> for one of the Manhattan neighborhoods.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:linkedcartogram"></span>
          <img src="pics3a/22_linkedcartogram.png" alt="Linked Cartogram and map" width="80%" />
          <p class="caption">
            Figure 59: Linked Cartogram and map
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Except for multi-layer and base map, the cartogram has all the same options as a regular choropleth map, with
          one addition.
          The positioning of the circles in the cartogram is the result of a non-linear optimization algorithm. This
          tries to locate the center of the circle as close as possible to the centroid of the areal unit with which it
          corresponds, while respecting the contiguity structure as much as possible. There is no unique solution to
          this problem, and it is often good practice to experiment with further iterations that will slightly
          reposition the circles. This is implemented in the <strong>Improve Cartogram</strong> option,
          shown in Figure <a href="#fig:improvecartogram">60</a>. A number of different iteration options are listed,
          together with the estimated time. The latter is particularly useful for larger data sets (but not in our
          example).</p>

      <h2>Map Animation</h2>
      <p>In <code>GeoDa</code>, map animation, or, more generally, any kind of animation is carried out through the
        animation tool. This is invoked by the <strong>Map Movie</strong> toolbar icon, shown in Figure <a
          href="#fig:mapmovieicon">61</a>, or from the <strong>Menu</strong>, as
        <strong>Map &gt; Map Movie</strong>.
      </p>
      <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:mapmovieicon"></span>

        <p class="caption">
          Figure 61: Map Movie icon
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>This brings up the <strong>Animation</strong> dialog, the control center through which the various aspects of
        the animation are controlled. The first item to specify is the <strong>Variable</strong> from the drop down
        list. We continue with <strong>rent2008</strong>, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:animationcontrol">62</a>.</p>
      <p>At the bottom of the dialog are the main controls: the start <strong>&gt;</strong> button, step-by-step forward
        <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> or backward <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong>, whether the animation loops or stops at the
        end, an option to <strong>Reverse</strong> the progress, the speed of the animation, and whether the order
        followed is ascending or descending. The defaults are usually good, with <strong>Cumulative</strong> checked
        (i.e., the selection grows as the animation progresses) and <strong>Ascending order</strong>.</p>
      <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:animationcontrol"></span>

          Figure 62: Map Movie variable selection
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>Once the forward button is activated, each observation is selected in turn, starting with the lowest value.
        This selection is not only for the map (the term map movie is a left-over from earlier versions), but for all
        currently active windows. The slider in the <strong>Animation</strong> dialog moves from left to right. Under
        the variable name, the currently selected observation and its value are listed. In our example,
        after 17 steps, the dialog looks as in Figure <a href="#fig:controlinprogress">63</a>.</p>

        </p>
      </div>
      <p>The current selected observation is listed as 51, with a value of 1000. The 17 lowest valued observations are
        highlighted in all currently open views, such as in the box map
        in Figure <a href="#fig:movieboxmap">64</a> (note how the status bar confirms that 17 observations were
        selected).</p>

      <p>The animation tool can be paused at any point, reversed, changed from continuous change to step-by-step, etc.,
        using the controls provided. The main point of the animation is to visually check for any patterns, such as all
        the lowest or highest values occurring in one location, or an increase in value that follows a given spatial
        trend (e.g., core-periphery, or East-West). Of course, this visual impression is only that, and will need to be
        confirmed with the more formal pattern detection methods that we will cover later.</p>
