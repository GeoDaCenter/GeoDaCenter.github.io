      "question": "What is GeoDa?",
      "answer": "GeoDa is a free software program that acts as an introduction to spatial analysis, designed to implement techniques for ESDA on lattice data (points and polygons). It is intended to provide a user friendly and graphical interface to methods of descriptive spatial data analysis, such as spatial autocorrelation statistics, as well as basic spatial regression functionality.",

      "question": "What websites are related to GeoDa?",
      "answer": "GeoDa's home on Github is http://geodacenter.github.io/. The Github pages for its sister programs GeoDaSpace and CAST can be accessed at https://github.com/GeoDaCenter. Additional information is available at its home institution, the University of Chicago's Center for Spatial Data Science.",

      "answer": "GeoDa stands for Geographic Data Analysis (pronounced geo-dah)."
    },
    {
      "id": "phil",
      "question": "What is the philosophy behind GeoDa?",
      "answer": "GeoDa is designed to implement specialized spatial analytic functionality like spatial autocorrelation test and spatial regression modeling. It is developed as a supplement rather than a substitute to existing geographic information systems (GIS) and statistics programs. As a result, it only implements basic GIS functions. If needed, users can save results to analyze them further in statistical packages or in CartoDB.",
