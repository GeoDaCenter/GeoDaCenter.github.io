Luc Anselin and Pedro Amaral have been [collaborating on new spatial econometric methods](https://global.uchicago.edu/news/new-methods-inequality-brazil) (endogenous spatial regimes) that they are applying to identify and address inequality in Brazil. Congratulations for receiving the Provostâ€™s Global Faculty Awards for Latin America and the Caribbean in 2023 and 2024 for this work!
