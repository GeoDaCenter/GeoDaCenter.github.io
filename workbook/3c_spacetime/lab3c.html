      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In this chapter, we will cover the basic procedures for setting up <em>time-enabled</em> variables in
        GeoDa through the <strong>Time Editor</strong>. These variables then become available for a simple form
        of space-time exploration in the limited sense of comparative statics. By means of the <strong>Time
          Player</strong>,
        maps and graphs pertaining to a given variable can be shown for different time periods, allowing
        for an albeit limited assessment of space-time dynamics.</p>
      <p>One limitation of this approach is that it is cross-section oriented. More precisely, the different
        time periods are considered as separate cross-sectional variables (one cross-section for each
        time period). While this results in quite a bit of flexibility when it comes to <em>grouping</em>
        variables, it also means there is no inherent time-awareness, nor a dedicated panel data structure.</p>
      <p>To illustrate these features, we
        will again use the data set with socio-economic characteristics for 55 New York City sub-boroughs
        that is available as a sample data set.</p>

        <h3>Getting started</h3>
        <p>With GeoDa launched and all previous projects closed, we start by loading the
          NYC Data from the <strong>Sample Data</strong> tab in the <strong>Connect to Data Source</strong> dialog.
          Since we will be creating a project file to store the space-time definitions that
          we construct, it is best to save a copy of this data set to a working directory.
          To accomplish this, we use <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong> and select ESRI Shapefile as the format.
          In the examples that follow, we have used <strong>NYC_Sub_borough_Area</strong> as the file name.</p>
        <p>Re-opening a project with the new data set yields the familiar themeless base map
          shown in Figure <a href="#fig:nycbasemap">1</a>.</p>

    <div id="time-editor" class="section level2 unnumbered">
      <h2>Time Editor</h2>
      <p>We start the process of <em>grouping</em> the data for the same variable over different time
        periods by invoking <strong>Time &gt; Editor</strong> from the main menu, as in Figure <a
          href="#fig:timeEditorMain">2</a>.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:timeEditorIcon">3</a>, we can select the <strong>Time</strong>
        icon on the toolbar (the latter brings up
        both the <strong>Time Editor</strong> and the <strong>Time Player</strong>).</p>

      <div id="grouping-variables" class="section level3 unnumbered">
        <h3>Grouping variables</h3>
        <p>The logic behind the time editor is that different variables are <em>grouped</em> under a single
          label, with an attached index that refers to the time period. For example, if we wanted to
          explore the evolution of the percentage households with children over time (the <strong>kidsxxxx</strong>
          variables in the data set), we would <em>group</em> the six variables <strong>kids2000</strong> to
          <strong>kids2009</strong> as
          a new time-enabled variable <strong>kids</strong>.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Time Editor</strong> interface is organized into three panels. The panel on the left, labeled
          <strong>Ungrouped Variables</strong>, contains the variables with their original variable name. In
          addition, after
          some operations, it also includes the variables that are not time-enabled (for example, a variable like the ID
          for the sub-borough, which does not change over time). The middle panel, <strong>New Group Details</strong>,
          is where the name and time labels for the new grouped variable can be edited. The
          right-most panel, <strong>Grouped Variables</strong>, lists the result of the grouping operations.
        </p>
        <p>The first step is to select the variables that are to be grouped in the left panel. For example,
          in Figure <a href="#fig:groupselectvars">5</a>, we highlighted six variables, from <strong>kids2000</strong>
          to <strong>kids2009</strong>.</p>

            Figure 5: Selection of variables to be grouped
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Clicking on the arrow button <strong>&gt;</strong> moves the variables over to the central panel, with
          a suggested variable name (<strong>kids200</strong>) and time labels (<strong>time 0</strong> through
          <strong>time 5</strong>),
          as illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:groupvarsinmiddle">6</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <div id="editing-the-time-label" class="section level4 unnumbered">
          <h4>Editing the time label</h4>
          <p>Both the time label and the variable name can be edited, as shown
            in Figures <a href="#fig:editTimeLabels">7</a>-<a href="#fig:editTimeLabels2">8</a>. Also, individual
            variables can be moved up or down in the sequence (the sequence determines the order
            of the comparatives static graphs and maps) by selecting the variable and using the
            buttons at the bottom of the panel. In addition, any variable can be moved out of the
            grouping, back to the ungrouped variables list, by selecting it and clicking on the left
            arrow button (<strong>&lt;</strong>) to the right of the central panel.</p>
          <p>For example, since the observations
            for 2005 to 2009 are every year, but the first observation is for 2000, we may want to remove
            <strong>kids2000</strong>
            from the list. This is accomplished by selecting the
            variable name and clicking on <strong>&lt;</strong>. This moves <strong>kids2000</strong> back to the
            ungrouped variables panel, but it leaves the first time label in place. We remove it
            by right clicking on the panel and selecting <strong>Remove Time</strong>, as shown in Figure <a
              href="#fig:editTimeLabels">7</a>.</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:editTimeLabels"></span>

              Figure 7: Removing variables and time labels
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>Next, we change the variable
            <strong>name</strong> from the suggested <strong>kids200</strong> to <strong>kids</strong> and start editing
            the time labels to show the actual year, as in Figure <a href="#fig:editTimeLabels2">8</a>.
          </p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:editTimeLabels2"></span>

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>At the end of the editing process, the <strong>New Group Details</strong> panels should look as in
            Figure <a href="#fig:cleanEditTimelabels">9</a>.</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:cleanEditTimelabels"></span>

          <p>The final step in the grouping process is to activate the group by selecting the <strong>&gt;</strong>
            arrow
            to the right of the central panel. This moves the new variable name to the
            <strong>Grouped Variables</strong> panel and clears the central panel, as in Figure <a
              href="#fig:variablesGrouped">10</a>.
          </p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:variablesGrouped"></span>

          <p>The original five variables in the data table are now replaced by a single entry, showing a
            new variable <strong>kids</strong>, with the first time period in parentheses (<strong>2005</strong>), as
            in Figure <a href="#fig:groupedVarsinTable">11</a>. The <strong>kids2000</strong>
            variable, which was not included in the grouping process, is still listed individually.</p>
          <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:groupedVarsinTable"></span>

          <p>Note that the grouped variables have not been dropped as
            individual entries, they are just not displayed as such in the table. The new label in parentheses indicates
            that they have been grouped.</p>
          <p>Finally, GeoDa is agnostic to what variables are grouped and in which order they are
            arranged, so this procedure can
            also be used to group variables that do not necessarily correspond to different time periods.
            For example, this may be useful when constructing a box plot graph that shows the box
            plots for multiple variables in one window.</p>

      <div id="saving-the-group-definitions-to-a-project-file" class="section level3 unnumbered">
        <h3>Saving the group definitions to a Project File</h3>
        <p>As we have seen previously in the discussion of custom categories, any special definition
          such as a grouped variable will be lost if it is not saved in a project
          file (accomplished through <strong>File &gt; Save Project</strong>). Once contained in a project file, the
          grouped variables can
          be re-used in later analyses. There can be several different project files associated
          with the same data layer, each focused on a special aspect of time dynamics.</p>
        <p>The project file contains the <strong>time_ids</strong> specified in the time editor, and the new
          variable definitions under the <strong>
            <group>
          </strong> entry. In our example, illustrated
          in Figure <a href="#fig:groupVarsinProject">12</a>, the variable
          <strong>kids</strong> is shown to be composed of <strong>kids2005</strong> through <strong>kids2009</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:groupVarsinProject"></span>

          <p class="caption">
            Figure 12: Grouped variable in project file
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Note that in the current setup in GeoDa, the grouping of variables can only use one set of
          time periods, due to the synchronization mechanism that underlies the time player. So,
          in order to look at different time periods, such as six periods for one variable
          and three for another, two separate project files would need to be created. More
          precisely, any active grouping has to pertain to the same time labels for all the grouped
          variable.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the use of grouped variables, we create a new project file with the variables

          the three years 2002, 2005, and
          2008. We store this in a new project file, say <strong>nyc_project2.gda</strong>. Then, we close

      <h2>Time Player</h2>
      <p>We start the time player by clicking on its icon, as in Figure <a href="#fig:timeEditorIcon">3</a>, or from the

        as <strong>Time &gt; Time Player</strong>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This

      </div>
      <p>The time player shows the <strong>Current time</strong> at the top, which is the time label that
        corresponds with the first period of the grouped variable (2002 in our example). For
        any graph or map in a current window, the time player will cycle through the time
        periods for the grouped variable(s) displayed. The radio button on the slider shows
        the progression over time. The controls at the bottom move the player forward
        automatically using the single arrow <strong>&gt;</strong>, or manually forward or backward using
        the double arrows <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong>. The default is to
        <strong>Loop</strong> (box checked) and
        to move forward (<strong>Reverse</strong> <em>not</em> checked). Note that <em>forward</em> is whatever order
        was used in the time editor, and is not automatically or necessarily the correct
        time sequence. As mentioned above, GeoDa is agnostic as to what is defined as the
        time order or time labels. Finally, the <strong>Speed</strong> of the automatic progression
        can be adjusted by means of the slider button.</p>
      <p>In practice, manual progressions typically provides the most insight.</p>
      <p>We will illustrate the use of the time player in some simple comparative
        static analysis of the a-spatial as well as the spatial distribution of a variable over time.
        We will consider the box plot, scatter plot and choropleth map as examples.</p>
      <div id="box-plot-over-time" class="section level3 unnumbered">
        <h3>Box plot over time</h3>
        <p>We start with a box plot. Selecting the box plot icon or menu item brings up the
          variable settings dialog, in the usual fashion, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:timevarsettings">14</a>.
          However, there is a difference with
          the case where no grouped variables are present.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:timevarsettings"></span>
          <img src="pics3c/5_504_boxplottimechoice.png" alt="Box plot variable selection" width="25%" />
          <p class="caption">
            Figure 14: Box plot variable selection
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Below the list of variables is a
          <strong>Time</strong> box that shows the currently active time label (2002 in our example). All
          time-enabled (grouped) variables in the interface have the first time label in parentheses
          next to their name (the variables without the parentheses are not time-enabled). A
          different time period can be selected from the <strong>Time</strong> drop down list, as displayed
          in Figure <a href="#fig:timevarsettings">14</a>.
          Once a different label is chosen, all variables in the list will show the updated
          label in parentheses.
        </p>
        <p>For now, we stay with the initial setting of 2002 and click on <strong>OK</strong> to bring up the
          box plot. In the default case, the box plots for all time periods are shown side
          by side, using the same axis for the associated values, as in Figure <a href="#fig:threeboxplots">15</a>.</p>
        <p>In our example, this clearly
          demonstrates the upward trend in median rent, something that would not be obvious
          in a standard (not time-enabled) box plot, since such plot is centered on its own median.
          In the default setting, the descriptive statistics for each period are listed below the plot.</p>

        <p>We can again use linking to identify the outliers, assess whether they remain outliers
          over time, and show them in a map. In this particular example, we have a few suspicious
          observations with a value of 0, likely due to a coding error. We ignore this aspect for now.</p>
        <p>The time-enabled box plot has a number of interesting options. Perhaps the most useful
          of these is the <strong>Number of Box Plots</strong>. As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:numberboxplots">16</a>,
          the default is to display <strong>All</strong>, but
          it is also possible to display any subset (1 or 2).</p>

          <p class="caption">
            Figure 16: Box plot options
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>For example, after changing this option to <strong>1</strong>, a single box plot appears, as in
          Figure <a href="#fig:numberboxplots1">17</a>. This graph
          displays
          the data for the first period, with 2002 listed in parentheses at the top of the graph. Consecutive
          clicking on the <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> icon in the <strong>Time Player</strong> will move the plot forward,
          one period
          at a time. The other options of the time player allow continuous looping, moving in
          reverse order, etc., as outlined above.</p>

            Figure 17: Single time period box plot
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Two other options of the time-enabled box plot warrant mentioning (the remaining options
          work the same way as for the standard box plot). The first item in the menu in
          Figure <a href="#fig:numberboxplots">16</a>,
          <strong>Scale Options</strong>, is set by default to <strong>Fixed scale over time</strong>. This only applies
          to
          the individual box plots, not to the (default) simultaneous graph. When cycling through
          the different time periods, the default is that the same scale is used for all. This allows
          for some visual impression of changing overall patterns over time (e.g., it would show
          the median bar moving up over time). When turned off, each individual time box plot is
          as it would be without having a time-enabled variable.
        </p>
        <p>The option at the bottom of the menu pertains to <strong>Time Variable Options</strong> and is set
          by default to synchronize all variables through the time control. This means that
          all graphs or maps that have been constructed for time-enabled variables
          will be synchronized to
          move through the time periods as managed by the time player. This is typically the
          desired behavior. Only in exceptional circumstances should this be turned off, for
          example, where a given plot should not change by time period.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="scatter-plot-over-time" class="section level3 unnumbered">
        <h3>Scatter plot over time</h3>
        <p>The scatter plot for time-enabled variables uses the same logic as the box plot.
          Again, the variables selection interface is enhanced with two <strong>Time</strong> boxes at the
          bottom, as in Figure <a href="#fig:timescattervars">18</a>. This allows for the time periods for the x and y
          variables
          to be different, for example, when comparing the same variable in two time periods, as illustrated
          in Figures <a href="#fig:timelagscattervars">21</a>-<a href="#fig:timelagscatterplot">22</a>.
          The time-enabled variables are listed with the corresponding time label in parentheses.</p>

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>To illustrate the operation of the scatter plot, we select <strong>hhsiz (2002)</strong> as the
          variable for the x-axis and <strong>rentpc (2002)</strong> as the variable for the y-axis. The
          corresponding scatter plot takes on the usual form, but now has the time labels
          listed next to each variable at the top of the plot, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:timescatterplot">19</a>.

          <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> in the time player. In our example in Figure <a href="#fig:timescatterplot2">20</a>,
          we see how the slope of the linear
          fit is no longer significant in 2005. All the usual scatter plot options apply (brushing, LOWESS

          <h4>Serially autoregressive scatter plot</h4>
          <p>One special feature of the time-enabled scatter plot is that it is very easy to
            consider a time-lagged bivariate regression. For example, we can select the
            <strong>yrhom</strong> variable in 2002 for the x-axis and the corresponding variable for 2005 in
            the y-axis, as in Figure <a href="#fig:timelagscattervars">21</a>.

          </div>
          <p>This results in an assessment of the magnitude of a one period temporal
            autoregression. In the graph in Figure <a href="#fig:timelagscatterplot">22</a>, it follows that the slope
            of 0.842 is highly significant.</p>

          <p>In the same way as before, this can be moved forward over time. Since there are only
            three period labels, there will only be two scatter plots considering a one-period lag.
            All the usual options apply.
            We do not pursue this further here.</p>

      <div id="maps-over-time" class="section level3 unnumbered">
        <h3>Maps over time</h3>
        <p>As our final example, we consider the application of time-enabled variables to
          choropleth mapping. This is one instance where the use of custom categories is
          especially useful. Unlike for the statistical graphs, there is no built-in <em>fixed scales</em>
          option for maps, but such scales can be defined through the <strong>Category Editor</strong>.</p>
        <p>For example, say that we want to assess the spatial distribution of median household
          size by sub-borough over time. We could create any of the choropleth map options
          starting with the <strong>hhsiz (2002)</strong> variable and then cycle through the three time
          periods by means of the time player. However, each of these maps would have its own
          (relative) classification, making it less intuitive to assess changes in absolute
          magnitude over time (as opposed to relative magnitude).</p>
        <p>Instead, we use the category editor to create a <strong>custom1</strong> break, starting with the
          <strong>hhsiz (2002)</strong> variable, making the breaks <strong>User-Defined</strong>, and turning the color
          scheme into <strong>sequential</strong>, with <strong>5</strong> categories. We manually enter the break
          points (somewhat arbitrarily) as 2, 2.5, 2.8 and 3. The result is as shown in Figure <a
            href="#fig:timecustombreaks">23</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:timecustombreaks"></span>

          <p class="caption">
            Figure 23: Custom break settings, household size
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>We now create a new map and choose <strong>Custom Breaks</strong> from the map menu, with
          <strong>custom1</strong> as the desired
          classification. The resulting map in Figure <a href="#fig:timemapcustom1">24</a> shows the spatial
          distribution of median household size
          for 2002.</p>
        <div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:timemapcustom1"></span>

            Figure 24: Household size, custom breaks 2002
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Moving through to the next period (2005) with the time player yields the map
          shown in Figure <a href="#fig:timemapcustom2">25</a> with the same legend
          classifications as in Figure <a href="#fig:timemapcustom1">24</a>. This way, in addition to comparing the
          spatial patterns, we see how the second category (2, 2.5) grows from 15 observations
          to 20, and the next to highest category (2.8, 3) goes from 13 to 7 observations.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Finally, moving to 2008 in Figure <a href="#fig:timemapcustom3">26</a> illustrates a further changing
          pattern, with now only 5 observations
          remaining in the categories above 2.8.</p>

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>The use of custom categories to evaluate changes in the spatial pattern over time is
          particularly useful when the breaks are dictated by substantive concerns, such as
          specific policy-related criteria.</p>
